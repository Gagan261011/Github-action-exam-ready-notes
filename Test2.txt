Question 1
Correct
You are reviewing a Docker container action and see this code as part of the entrypoint.sh file. What does this code indicate?



if <condition> ; then
  echo "Writing Message"
  exit 1
fi
the workflow has failed to write logs, but is exiting with a successful exit code

the workflow was successful, but an optional step failed

Your answer is correct
a task has failed, and the code is setting a failure exit code

the workflow was successful, and the code is exiting as successful

Overall explanation
In this code snippet, the if statement checks a condition. If the condition evaluates to true, the message "Writing Message" is printed to the standard output using the echo command. Subsequently, the action exits with a failure status code (1) using the exit command. This indicates that the action encountered an issue or failed due to the condition being met.

********************
WRONG ANSWERS:

since the exit code is nonzero, the workflow has failed

How can you add the action you've created to the GitHub Marketplace?

renaming the repository to match an existing GitHub feature

Explanation
Renaming the repository to match an existing GitHub feature is not the correct way to add the action you've created to the GitHub Marketplace. Repository names do not directly affect the visibility or availability of actions in the Marketplace.
merging a pull request from another user

Explanation
Merging a pull request from another user is not the correct way to add the action you've created to the GitHub Marketplace. Pull requests are used for code review and collaboration, but they do not automatically publish the action to the Marketplace for broader usage.
creating a new branch in your repository

Explanation
Creating a new branch in your repository is not the correct way to add the action you've created to the GitHub Marketplace. Branches are used for development and version control within the repository, but they do not directly impact the availability of the action in the Marketplace.
Correct answer
tagging it as a new release and then publishing it

Explanation
Tagging the action as a new release and then publishing it is the correct way to add the action you've created to the GitHub Marketplace. By tagging it as a new release, you are indicating that the action is ready for distribution, and publishing it makes it available for other users to discover and use in the Marketplace.
Overall explanation
You can add the action you've created to the GitHub Marketplace by tagging it as a new release and then publishing it. There are a few guided steps in GitHub that allow you to publish a release of your action. You can find more information on these steps in the Summary section at the end of this module.

********************
WRONG ANSWERS:

adding the action to the GitHub Marketplace involves tagging it as a new release, not creating a new branch.

Your organization requires IP allowlists to protect internal resources accessed by GitHub Actions workflows. Most of your workflows run on GitHub-hosted runners, with both Windows and macOS needs. How can you achieve this desired security while ensuring workflow reliability?

create separate workflows for accessing internal resources, using only self-hosted runners and bypassing IP allowlists entirely

Explanation
Creating separate workflows for accessing internal resources and using only self-hosted runners to bypass IP allowlists entirely may seem like a workaround, but it can introduce security vulnerabilities. By bypassing IP allowlists, you are potentially exposing internal resources to unauthorized access, which goes against the security requirements of implementing IP allowlists for protection.
configure IP allowlists on internal resources to include the entire Azure IP address range, as GitHub-hosted Windows and Ubuntu runners operate within Azure.

Explanation
Configuring IP allowlists on internal resources to include the entire Azure IP address range may seem like a comprehensive solution, but it can lead to potential security risks by allowing access from a broader range of sources than necessary. This approach may not align with the principle of least privilege and could compromise the security of internal resources.
implement self-hosted runners on-premises with specific IP addresses added to the allowlist

Explanation
Implementing self-hosted runners on-premises with specific IP addresses added to the allowlist can be a valid approach for controlling access to internal resources. However, this option may introduce additional complexity and maintenance overhead compared to utilizing GitHub-hosted runners with static IP address ranges.
Correct answer
utilize large runners with static IP address ranges and add these ranges to the allowlist

Explanation
Utilizing large runners with static IP address ranges allows you to easily add these ranges to the IP allowlist for internal resources. This ensures that only workflows running on these specific runners can access the protected resources, providing the desired security measures while maintaining workflow reliability.
Overall explanation
Utilizing large runners with static IP address ranges and adding these ranges to the allowlist offers a secure and manageable solution because larger runners provide increased flexibility and isolation compared to standard hosted runners. Their static IP address ranges simplify allowlist configuration, enabling secure access to internal resources. This approach balances security and efficiency, ensuring reliable workflows with appropriate protections.

********************
WRONG ANSWERS:

The Azure IP address range is vast and constantly changing, making it impractical and insecure for allowlisting.

While secure, self-hosted runners add maintenance overhead and potential network access complexity.

Bypassing allowlists for sensitive resources creates a security vulnerability.

Which configuration is appropriate for triggering a workflow on a commit to a feature branch?

on:
  push:
    types:
      - 'feature'
Explanation
This configuration specifies that the workflow should be triggered on a push event with a type of 'feature'. However, push events do not have types like 'feature', so this configuration is not valid for triggering a workflow on a commit to a feature branch.
Correct answer
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - 'feature/*'
Explanation
This configuration specifies that the workflow should be triggered on a push event to any branch that starts with 'feature/'. This is the correct configuration for triggering a workflow on a commit to a feature branch.
on: push
Explanation
This configuration simply triggers the workflow on any push event, without specifying any branch conditions. It does not specifically target commits to feature branches, so it is not appropriate for the given requirement.
on:
  commit:
    branches:
      - 'feature/*'
Explanation
This configuration specifies that the workflow should be triggered on a commit event to branches that start with 'feature/'. However, the correct event to trigger a workflow on a commit is 'push', not 'commit'. Therefore, this configuration is not appropriate for triggering a workflow on a commit to a feature branch.
Overall explanation
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - 'feature/*'
With this configuration, the workflow will run whenever a commit is pushed to any branch that starts with feature/. Adjust the branch pattern (feature/*) as needed to match your specific naming conventions for feature branches.

on: Specifies the events that trigger the workflow.

push: Indicates that the workflow should trigger on a push event.

branches: Specifies the branches that should trigger the workflow. In this case, it's set to trigger on any push to branches starting with feature/.

******************

WRONG



on: push
This configuration triggers the workflow on any push event, regardless of the branch. While it would trigger the workflow for commits to feature branches as well, it doesn't specifically target feature branches and might trigger the workflow for pushes to other branches, which may not be desired.



on:
  push:
    types:
      - 'feature'
This configuration attempts to use the types attribute to filter pushes based on the type of branch. However, the types attribute is not used for filtering branches; instead, it specifies the type of push event, such as created, deleted, or pushed. Therefore, using 'feature' as a type doesn't make sense in this context.



on:
  commit:
    branches:
      - 'feature/*'
This configuration is incorrect because there is no commit event type in GitHub Actions. The correct event type for triggering workflows on push events is push, not commit.

What action should be taken if you want to find the expiration date of a specific artifact?

navigate to the “Actions” tab, click on the workflow, and check the summary for expiration information

Explanation
Navigating to the "Actions" tab, clicking on the workflow, and checking the summary will not give you the expiration date of a specific artifact. The summary typically includes information about the workflow run, status, and duration, but it does not provide details about artifact expiration dates.
Correct answer
execute a specific API call to retrieve the expiration date

Explanation
To find the expiration date of a specific artifact in GitHub Actions, you need to execute a specific API call that retrieves the expiration date information. This API call will provide you with the necessary details about when the artifact will expire, allowing you to manage it effectively.
use the “Artifacts” tab on the GitHub repository page

Explanation
Using the "Artifacts" tab on the GitHub repository page will not provide you with the expiration date of a specific artifact. This tab is primarily used for managing and viewing artifacts, but it does not display information about their expiration dates.
the expiration date of an artifact cannot be determined in GitHub Actions

Explanation
Contrary to the statement, the expiration date of an artifact can be determined in GitHub Actions. By executing a specific API call or following the correct steps, you can retrieve the expiration date information for a specific artifact.
Overall explanation
The expiration date of an artifact can be confirmed using the API, specifically by checking the expires_at value returned by the “Actions” API

********************
WRONG ANSWERS:

The “Artifacts” tab is not used to find the expiration date of a specific artifact

Finding the expiration date of an artifact is not through the “Actions” tab

You are planning to manage reusable workflows for your organization within GitHub Actions. Which approach is recommended for optimal organization and maintainability?

reuse workflows directly from individual project repositories.

Explanation
Reusing workflows directly from individual project repositories may lead to duplication of workflows across multiple projects, making it difficult to maintain consistency and updates. It can also result in inconsistencies in workflow implementations and increase the risk of errors or outdated workflows being used in different projects.
Correct answer
create a dedicated repository to store and manage all reusable workflows

Explanation
Creating a dedicated repository to store and manage all reusable workflows is recommended for optimal organization and maintainability. This approach centralizes all reusable workflows in one location, making it easier to manage, update, and share them across multiple projects within the organization. It also helps in maintaining consistency and standardization in workflow implementations.
implement version control for reusable workflows using branches and tags

Explanation
Implementing version control for reusable workflows using branches and tags is a good practice to track changes and updates to the workflows. However, relying solely on branches and tags for version control may not provide the same level of organization and maintainability as having a dedicated repository for all reusable workflows. It is important to have a centralized location for managing and sharing reusable workflows effectively.
utilize the workflow_call trigger within workflows to call reusable workflows from other repositories

Explanation
Utilizing the workflow_call trigger within workflows to call reusable workflows from other repositories can introduce complexity and dependencies between workflows. This approach may make it harder to track and manage the relationships between different workflows, leading to potential issues with version control, updates, and maintenance.

Overall explanation
While setting up reusable workflows in your target repository and reusing them in other workflows are standard ways supported by GitHub Actions, it also supports reusing workflows from other repositories in the same user account or organization. You can make use of this feature to better organize your reusable workflows.

If you plan to set up multiple reusable workflows in your organization, it might be a good idea to set up a common workflow repository. This allows you to track the development of reusable workflows better, reuse them in a standard fashion across your organization, and version them for easier access.

********************
WRONG ANSWERS:

Reusing workflows directly from individual project repositories leads to scattered workflows across repositories, making it difficult to track changes, updates, and versions.

While utilizing the workflow_call trigger can be effective for individual workflows, managing numerous reusable workflows across repositories directly becomes cumbersome.

Version control is essential, but managing versions within individual project repositories doesn't address the need for a centralized location for reusability.

In GitHub Actions, if you define both branches and paths filter, what is the effect on the workflow execution?

the workflow will run when either branches or paths are satisfied

Explanation
This statement is incorrect because when both branches and paths filters are defined, the workflow will not run if only one of the conditions is satisfied. It requires both the branches and paths to match the defined criteria for the workflow to execute.

the workflow will run when either branches or paths are satisfied, but will only apply the matching filter

Explanation
This statement is incorrect because when both branches and paths filters are defined, the workflow will not run if only one of the conditions is satisfied. It requires both the branches and paths to match the defined criteria for the workflow to execute.

Correct answer
the workflow will only run when both branches and paths are satisfied

Explanation
When both branches and paths filters are defined in GitHub Actions, the workflow will only run when both conditions are satisfied. This means that the workflow will only execute if the changes occur in the specified branches and the specified paths are affected.

the workflow will not run when both branches and paths are satisfied

Explanation
This statement is incorrect because when both branches and paths filters are defined, the workflow will run when both conditions are satisfied. It will not prevent the workflow from executing when the specified branches and paths meet the defined criteria.

Overall explanation
Use the branches filter when you want to include branch name patterns or when you want to both include and exclude branch name patterns. Use the branches-ignore filter when you only want to exclude branch name patterns. You cannot use both the branches and branches-ignore filters for the same event in a workflow.

If you define both branches/branches-ignore and paths/paths-ignore, the workflow will only run when both filters are satisfied.

*********************
WRONG ANSWERS:

The filters are not an "OR" condition between branches and paths, both need to be satisfied

If an organization's templated workflow contains secret information such as ${{ secrets.token }}, what needs to be configured before using the workflow?

Correct answer
create a secret named token in your repository

Explanation
In order to use the secret information in the templated workflow, a secret named token needs to be created in the repository. This allows the workflow to access and use the secret value securely during its execution.

skip configuring secrets and rely on default values

Explanation
Skipping the configuration of secrets and relying on default values is not a secure practice, especially when dealing with sensitive information like tokens. It is essential to properly configure secrets to ensure the security of the workflow and the organization's data.
replace the ${{ secrets.token }} with the token's value

Explanation
Simply replacing the ${{ secrets.token }} with the token's value directly in the workflow is not recommended as it exposes the secret information in plain text, compromising its security. It is important to keep sensitive information secure by using GitHub secrets.

configure the workflow file to remove the secret information

Explanation
Configuring the workflow file to remove the secret information is not the correct approach as the secret information is necessary for the workflow to function properly. Instead of removing the secret, it is important to properly configure and manage secrets in the repository.
Overall explanation
Because the templated workflow contains secret information $ {{ secrets.token }}, the organization needs to configure the secrets before using the templated workflow. These secrets should be added to the organization's secrets store in GitHub.  Create a secret named token and store its value as a secret in your repository.

******************

WRONG ANSWERS



Replacing the $ {{ secrets.token }} placeholder with the actual token value directly in the workflow file is not recommended because it introduces security risks, lacks manageability, and violates security best practices.

Relying on default values without configuring secrets is not a viable option, especially when the workflow requires sensitive information such as API tokens or passwords. Default values may not be secure or appropriate for the organization's needs, and it's essential to configure secrets to ensure the workflow operates securely.

Removing the secret information from the workflow file because the secret is essential for the workflow to function properly.  If the secret is simply removed from the configuration the workflow run will result in an error.

You need to create a custom Javascript action for your organization, but there are problems in the actions.yml file in the code snippet shown below. What is the problem with the code?



runs:
  using: 'node12'
  steps: 'main.js'
The Javascript action requires node20, and the code above references node12

Explanation
The issue in the code is not related to the specific version of Node.js being used. While it is important to specify the correct Node.js version in the 'using' key, the error in the code snippet is the incorrect usage of the 'steps' argument within the 'runs' section.
Correct answer
The Javascript action does not use the steps argument. Change it and use the main argument instead

Explanation
The problem with the code is that the 'steps' argument is being used incorrectly. In a GitHub Actions workflow file, the 'runs' key should have a 'main' key instead of 'steps' to specify the main entry point of the action, which in this case is 'main.js'.
The Javascript action does not require Node.js and therefore this action will fail

Explanation
The problem with the code is not that the Javascript action does not require Node.js. In fact, Node.js is necessary for running Javascript actions in GitHub Actions. The error lies in the incorrect usage of the 'steps' argument within the 'runs' section of the actions.yml file.
The Javascript action does not use the action.yml file, it requires a index.js file instead

Explanation
The issue in the code is not related to the use of the action.yml file or the requirement for an index.js file. The problem lies in the incorrect usage of the 'steps' argument within the 'runs' section of the actions.yml file.
Overall explanation
JavaScript actions can run directly on the runner machine and separate the action code from the environment used to run the action. Because of this, the action code is simplified and can execute faster than actions within a Docker container.

As a prerequisite for creating and using packaged JavaScript actions, you need to download Node.js, which includes npm. As an optional step (but one that we recommend), use GitHub Actions Toolkit Node.js, which is a collection of Node.js packages that allows you to quickly build JavaScript actions with more consistency.

JavaScript actions require that the runs statement takes the following two arguments:

using: Application used to execute the code as defined in main

main: File that contains the action code; the application defined in using executes this file

********************
WRONG ANSWERS:

The Javascript action still requires the action.yml file, but it also uses an index.js file that includes context information about the Toolkil packages, routing, and other functions of the action

The Javascript action does not specifically require node12, but it does require a Node.js package

When selecting a runner for GitHub Actions that is cost-effective and requires minimal management, which option would be most suitable?

Correct answer
GitHub-hosted runners provided by GitHub

Explanation
GitHub-hosted runners provided by GitHub are the most cost-effective option as they are free for public repositories and offer a certain amount of free minutes for private repositories. They require minimal management as GitHub takes care of the infrastructure and maintenance of these runners, allowing users to focus on their workflows.
Self-hosted runners on physical servers maintained by the organization

Explanation
Self-hosted runners on physical servers maintained by the organization can be costly in terms of hardware, maintenance, and energy consumption. They also require more management effort for setup, maintenance, and monitoring, making them less suitable for a cost-effective and minimally managed solution.
Self-hosted runners on virtual machines managed by the organization

Explanation
Self-hosted runners on virtual machines managed by the organization may require additional costs for maintaining the virtual machines and ensuring their availability and performance. While they offer more control over the environment, they also require more management effort compared to GitHub-hosted runners.
Cloud-hosted runners from a third-party provider

Explanation
Cloud-hosted runners from a third-party provider may offer flexibility and scalability, but they can also incur additional costs depending on the provider and usage. They require management for provisioning, monitoring, and maintenance, which may not align with the goal of minimizing management efforts.
Overall explanation
In scenarios where cost-effectiveness and minimal management are priorities, GitHub-hosted runners provided by GitHub are the most suitable option for GitHub Actions. These runners are maintained and managed by GitHub, eliminating the need for organizations to handle infrastructure setup, maintenance, and costs, thereby providing a hassle-free and economical solution for CI/CD workflows.

********************
WRONG ANSWERS:

Self-hosted runners on virtual machines managed by the organization may offer more control but require ongoing maintenance, which contradicts the requirement for minimal management.

Self-hosted runners on physical servers maintained by the organization involve significant management efforts and are less cost-effective than other options.

Cloud-hosted runners from a third-party provider could be cost-effective, but they often require management overhead, making them less suitable for scenarios where minimal management is desired.

How do events, workflows, jobs, steps, and runs collaborate in a typical scenario?

runs initiate actions, which consist of one or more steps executed within jobs and workflows

Explanation
This is incorrect. In a typical scenario, an event triggers a workflow, which then executes one or more jobs. Each job can consist of one or more steps that need to be completed as part of the workflow process. This sequence ensures that the necessary actions are taken in response to the initial event.

steps initiate actions, which are executed within workflows and result in runs within one or more jobs

Explanation
This is incorrect. In a typical scenario, an event triggers a workflow, which then executes one or more jobs. Each job can consist of one or more steps that need to be completed as part of the workflow process. This sequence ensures that the necessary actions are taken in response to the initial event.

jobs initiate runs, which consist of one or more actions with individual steps in a collaborative workflow

Explanation
This is incorrect. In a typical scenario, an event triggers a workflow, which then executes one or more jobs. Each job can consist of one or more steps that need to be completed as part of the workflow process. This sequence ensures that the necessary actions are taken in response to the initial event.

Correct answer
an event will trigger a  workflow which will execute one or more jobs which consists of one or more steps

Explanation
In a typical scenario, an event triggers a workflow, which then executes one or more jobs. Each job can consist of one or more steps that need to be completed as part of the workflow process. This sequence ensures that the necessary actions are taken in response to the initial event.
Overall explanation
In GitHub Actions, workflows define automation processes triggered by events, jobs group tasks that run on specified environments, steps are individual tasks within jobs, and actions are reusable scripts within steps. A run is the execution of a workflow, executing its jobs and steps in sequence or parallel as defined.

********************
WRONG ANSWERS:

Steps do not initiate actions; rather, they are part of the workflow structure

You need to store a sensitive database password for your organization's GitHub Actions workflows. As an organization owner, how can you create a secure secret accessible only to specific repositories within your organization?

create a repository secret in the main project repository and manually share it with other needed repositories

Explanation
Creating a repository secret in the main project repository and manually sharing it with other needed repositories is not the most efficient or secure method. This approach can lead to manual errors, inconsistencies in secret management, and potential security risks. It is better to utilize organization-level secrets with restricted access policies for better security.
hardcode the password directly within your workflows for ease of access

Explanation
Hardcoding the password directly within your workflows is not a secure practice, as it exposes the sensitive information to anyone who has access to the code. Storing passwords in plain text within the workflows can lead to security vulnerabilities and compromise the confidentiality of the information.
allow public access to the main repository and utilize private workflow permissions for individual runs

Explanation
Allowing public access to the main repository and utilizing private workflow permissions for individual runs can expose sensitive information to unauthorized users. Public access to repositories can lead to security breaches and compromise the confidentiality of the stored secrets. It is important to use organization-level secrets with restricted access policies for better security practices.
Correct answer
create an organization-level secret and configure a policy to limit access to only the specific repositories that can use it

Explanation
Creating an organization-level secret allows you to store sensitive information securely at the organization level. By configuring a policy to limit access to only specific repositories, you can ensure that the secret is only accessible to the workflows within those repositories that require it. This approach helps maintain security and restricts access to sensitive information.
Overall explanation
Create an organization-level secret and configure a policy to limit access to only the specific repositories that can use it offers the best balance of security and efficiency since it stores the password securely and centrally, reducing redundancy and simplifying management. It also provides granular control by restricting access to only the authorized repositories using the password.

********************
WRONG ANSWERS:

Sharing secrets manually across repositories is prone to human error and creates security risks. Repository secrets are also limited to one specific repository.

Hardcoding secrets within workflows expose them in code history and is a major security vulnerability.

Allowing public access to the main repository defeats the purpose of securing the password. While private workflow permissions offer some control, they don't address the vulnerability of the publicly accessible repository.

Jess is looking to programmatically access a set of workflow logs for a public repository.  What pieces of information are required for accessing a set of workflow logs?

owner, repo and job_id

Explanation
While the owner and repo are necessary to identify the repository, the job_id is not required to access a set of workflow logs. The job_id is used to identify a specific job within a workflow run, not the overall set of logs for the entire workflow run.
Correct answer
owner, repo and run_id

Explanation
The owner, repo, and run_id are the essential pieces of information required to access a specific workflow run's logs in a public repository. The owner identifies the user or organization that owns the repository, the repo specifies the repository name, and the run_id uniquely identifies the workflow run.
owner, repo, and authentication token

Explanation
While the owner, repo, and authentication token are important for accessing repository resources, the authentication token is not specifically required to access a set of workflow logs for a public repository. Workflow logs in a public repository are generally accessible without the need for an authentication token.
repo, authentication token, and run_id

Explanation
The repo and run_id are necessary to identify the repository and the specific workflow run for accessing workflow logs. However, the authentication token is not required for accessing workflow logs in a public repository. Authentication tokens are typically used for accessing private repository resources or performing specific actions within a workflow.
Overall explanation
To access workflow logs programmatically, Jess needs to provide the owner (username or organization name) and the repository name, which specify the repository containing the workflows. Additionally, the run_id uniquely identifies a particular workflow run, allowing Jess to target the specific logs she wants to access.  Here is a sample curl request to programmatically access logs using these pieces of information:



curl -L \
  -H "Accept: application/vnd.github+json" \
  -H "X-GitHub-Api-Version: 2022-11-28" \
  https://api.github.com/repos/OWNER/REPO/actions/runs/RUN_ID/logs
******************

WRONG ANSWERS



While the owner and repository name are required to identify the repository containing the workflows, the job_id is not typically used to access workflow logs. The job_id identifies a specific job within a workflow run, not the entire run or its logs.

While providing the owner and repository name is necessary to identify the repository containing the workflows, an authentication token is not specifically required to access logs from a public repository. Public repositories on GitHub typically do not require authentication tokens for accessing their contents.

While the repository name is required to identify the repository containing the workflows, an authentication token is not typically required for accessing logs from a public repository. Additionally, the run_id alone is insufficient to identify the owner and repository containing the logs.

How does the cache action in a GitHub Actions handle a cache miss?

Correct answer
by automatically creating a new cache if the job is completed successfully

Explanation
The cache action in GitHub Actions handles a cache miss by automatically creating a new cache if the job is completed successfully. This ensures that future runs of the workflow can benefit from the cached data, improving overall workflow performance.
by requiring manual intervention to create a new cache

Explanation
The cache action does not require manual intervention to create a new cache in the event of a cache miss. It is designed to handle cache misses automatically by creating a new cache when needed.
by searching for a cache in other repositories

Explanation
The cache action in GitHub Actions does not search for a cache in other repositories in the event of a cache miss. It is specific to the repository where the workflow is running and will create a new cache if necessary.
by terminating the workflow if a cache miss occurs

Explanation
The cache action does not terminate the workflow if a cache miss occurs. Instead, it allows the workflow to continue running without the cached data, and it will create a new cache if the job is completed successfully.
Overall explanation
If there is a cache miss and the job completes successfully, the cache action automatically creates a new cache with the specified key and contents

********************

The location of the README file does not impact the execution of a Docker container action. The README file can be placed within the same directory supporting the Docker container action without affecting its functionality, making this choice incorrect.

Overall explanation
Docker can build images automatically by reading the instructions from a Dockerfile. A Dockerfile is a text document that contains all the commands a user could call on the command line to assemble an image. Make sure that your filename is capitalized correctly (use a capital D but not a capital f) if you're having issues.

********************
WRONG ANSWERS:

All actions require a metadata file. The metadata filename must be either action.yml or action.yaml.

The README file is fine to keep in the same directory to properly document the action

The README file doesn't need to reference any files directly in order for the Docker container action to work properly. It's merely there for documentation

Jeff is troubleshooting an error within his workflow configuration causing it not to run.  What is wrong with this workflow configuration?



name: learn-github-actions
run-name: ${{ github.actor }} is testing out GitHub Actions 🚀
jobs:
  Explore-GitHub-Actions:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - run: echo "🎉 The job was automatically triggered by a ${{ github.event_name }} event."
      - run: echo "🐧 This job is now running on a ${{ runner.os }} server hosted by GitHub!"
      - run: echo "🔎 The name of your branch is ${{ github.ref }} and your repository is ${{ github.repository }}."
      - name: List files in the repository
        run: |
          ls ${{ github.workspace }}
each run: keyword must have an unqiue step: keyword before it

Explanation
Each 'run:' keyword in the workflow configuration does not require a unique 'step:' keyword before it. The 'step:' keyword is used to define individual steps within a job, while the 'run:' keyword is used to execute commands within those steps. The issue with the configuration lies in the missing 'on:' keyword to trigger the workflow.
Correct answer
missing the on: keyword to specify what events will trigger the workflow

Explanation
The workflow configuration is missing the 'on:' keyword, which is used to specify what events will trigger the workflow to run. Without this keyword, the workflow will not be triggered by any events, causing it not to run as expected.
the indentation of the configuration is invalid

Explanation
The indentation of the configuration does not appear to be invalid based on the provided snippet. Indentation is important for readability but does not impact the functionality of the workflow. The main issue causing the workflow not to run is the missing 'on:' keyword to specify triggering events.
the name: keyword is not allowed under the steps section of the configuration

Explanation
The 'name:' keyword is allowed under the 'steps' section of the configuration to provide a descriptive name for a specific step. However, in this case, the issue is not related to the 'name:' keyword, but rather the missing 'on:' keyword to specify triggering events for the workflow.
Overall explanation
In this configuration, there is no  on: key specified, which means the workflow will not be triggered by any events. Without the on: key, the workflow will not have any triggers defined, and therefore, it won't run automatically in response to any events such as pushes, pull requests, or other GitHub Actions events.

*******************

WRONG ANSWERS:

The name keyword is allowed under the steps section of a job configuration in GitHub Actions. It's used to provide a descriptive name for individual steps within the job.

In GitHub Actions workflow syntax, each run keyword represents a shell command or script to be executed as part of a step within the workflow. These run commands are defined directly under the steps section and each run does not require a unique preceding step keyword.

The configuration is valid YAML with proper indentation

John is troubleshooting a failed workflow run and would like to view the workflow file associated with the failed run.  What option can he select within the failed run's menu to easily view the workflow file?

Correct answer
View workflow file

Explanation
By selecting the "View workflow file" option within the failed run's menu, John can easily access and view the workflow file associated with the failed run. This option allows him to quickly identify any issues or errors in the workflow configuration that may have caused the failure.
View raw logs

Explanation
Selecting the "View raw logs" option within the failed run's menu will display the raw logs generated during the workflow run. While this can help in understanding the sequence of events leading to the failure, it does not provide direct access to the workflow file for troubleshooting purposes.
Download log archive

Explanation
The "Download log archive" option within the failed run's menu allows John to download a compressed archive file containing all the logs generated during the workflow run. While this can be useful for detailed analysis, it does not directly provide access to the workflow file itself.
Create status badge

Explanation
The "Create status badge" option within the failed run's menu is used to generate a status badge that can be embedded in README files or other documentation to display the status of the workflow run. This option does not provide access to the workflow file itself for viewing or troubleshooting the failed run.
Overall explanation
To easily view the workflow file associated with a failed run, John can select the "View workflow file" option in the failed run's menu. This option allows him to quickly access and inspect the workflow file that was used for the failed run, helping him troubleshoot the issue more effectively.

******************

WRONG ANSWERS



While downloading the log archive provides access to the logs generated during the workflow run, it does not directly lead to viewing the workflow file. The log archive contains information about the execution of the workflow but does not include the workflow file itself.

Viewing the raw logs allows John to inspect the detailed logs generated during the workflow run, but it does not provide access to the workflow file. The raw logs display information about each step's execution and any error messages encountered but do not include the workflow file.

Creating a status badge generates a badge image that represents the status of the workflow run, but it does not provide access to the workflow file. Status badges are typically used to display the overall status of the workflow on external websites or README files but do not contain information about the workflow file itself.

What is the purpose of the continue-on-error keyword in a GitHub Actions step?

it defines conditions under which a step should be retried

Explanation
This choice is incorrect because the continue-on-error keyword does not define conditions under which a step should be retried. It focuses on how the workflow should handle errors in a specific step, rather than retrying the step under certain conditions.

Correct answer
it allows the workflow to continue even if the step fails

Explanation
The continue-on-error keyword in a GitHub Actions step allows the workflow to continue running even if the specific step fails. This can be useful in scenarios where a failure in a particular step should not halt the entire workflow, but rather allow other steps to continue executing.

it specifies the steps to run only on error conditions

Explanation
This choice is incorrect because the continue-on-error keyword does not specify that the steps should only run on error conditions. Instead, it specifically deals with how the workflow should proceed if a step encounters an error.

it indicates that the step should always be executed, regardless of errors

Explanation
This choice is incorrect because the continue-on-error keyword does not indicate that the step should always be executed, regardless of errors. It specifically handles the behavior of the workflow when a step fails.

Overall explanation
The continue-on-error keyword in a step allows the workflow to continue even if a step fails. The user would have to set this to true to allow this to happen. This can be useful in scenarios where you want to proceed with the workflow despite non-critical step failures.

********************
WRONG ANSWERS:

The continue-on-error keyword does not specify the steps to run only on error conditions; it allows the workflow to continue after the failed step

The keyword does not indicate that a step should always be executed; it only affects the workflow continuation in case of errors

The keyword does not allow conditions to be retired, and it allows the workflow to keep moving forward even if the step fails

Which of the following statements accurately describes the behavior of workflow jobs referencing an environment's protection rules?

Correct answer
workflow jobs won't start until all of the environment's protection rules pass

Explanation
This statement is correct because workflow jobs that reference an environment's protection rules will not start until all of the defined protection rules pass. This ensures that the environment is properly protected before any jobs are executed.
workflow jobs will never start if the environment has protection rules

Explanation
This statement is incorrect as workflow jobs can start once all of the environment's protection rules pass. If the protection rules are successfully met, the jobs will be allowed to run within the specified environment.
workflow jobs will start immediately, regardless of the environment's protection rules

Explanation
This statement is incorrect as workflow jobs that reference an environment's protection rules will not start immediately. They are required to wait until all of the protection rules are successfully passed before they can begin execution.
workflow jobs will only start if some of the environment's protection rules pass

Explanation
This statement is incorrect because workflow jobs will not start if any of the environment's protection rules fail. All protection rules must pass for the jobs to start, not just some of them.
Overall explanation
When a workflow job references an environment, the job won't start until all of the environment's protection rules pass

*******************

WRONG ANSWERS:

All of the environment's protection rules must pass before the workflow jobs referencing that environment will start. If any protection rule fails, the jobs will not begin execution.

Workflow jobs will start once all of the environment's protection rules pass. The purpose of the protection rules is to ensure that the environment meets certain criteria before allowing the jobs to proceed, not to prevent the jobs from ever starting.

Steve would like to use an action in his GitHub project but wants to validate that it is trustworthy before using it.  What steps can Steve take to verify the integrity of a GitHub action before deciding to use it? (select three)

Check the action's GitHub stars

Explanation
Checking the action's GitHub stars may provide some indication of its popularity and community support, but it does not directly verify the integrity or trustworthiness of the action. The number of stars does not necessarily correlate with the quality or security of the code.
Correct selection
Check if the action is in the GitHub Marketplace

Explanation
Checking if the action is available in the GitHub Marketplace provides an additional layer of validation. Actions listed in the Marketplace have undergone some level of review and approval by GitHub, which can indicate a certain level of trustworthiness.
Correct selection
Review the action.yml file to make sure the code does what it says it does

Explanation
Reviewing the action.yml file is essential to understand the functionality and purpose of the GitHub action. By examining the code, Steve can verify that the action performs the intended tasks and does not contain any malicious code that could compromise the security of his project.

Correct selection
Check if the action is verified in the GitHub Marketplace

Explanation
Verifying if the action is officially verified in the GitHub Marketplace adds another level of assurance. Actions that are verified by GitHub have undergone a more thorough review process, giving Steve more confidence in their reliability and security.
Overall explanation
Review the action's action.yml file for inputs, outputs, and to make sure the code does what it says it does.

Check if the action is in the GitHub Marketplace. This is a good check, even if an action does not have to be on the GitHub Marketplace to be valid.

Check if the action is verified in the GitHub Marketplace. This means that GitHub has approved the use of this action. However, you should still review it before using it.

******************

WRONG ANSWERS

GitHub stars can indicate popularity or community endorsement, they don't necessarily reflect the trustworthiness or integrity of an action. Some actions might have many stars but could still have security vulnerabilities or be poorly maintained. Relying solely on stars might not provide an accurate assessment of an action's quality.

How do custom labels determine the eligibility of a self-hosted runner to process a job?

Correct answer
labels are cumulative, and the runner must have all assigned labels to be eligible

Explanation
In GitHub Actions, custom labels are cumulative, meaning that a self-hosted runner must have all assigned labels to be eligible to process a job. This ensures that the runner meets all the specific requirements set by the labels.
labels are mutually exclusive, and only one matching label is required

Explanation
This statement is incorrect. Custom labels in GitHub Actions are not mutually exclusive. The runner must have all assigned labels to be eligible, as labels are cumulative in determining the runner's eligibility to process a job.
labels operate independently, and any matching label makes the runner eligible

Explanation
This statement is incorrect. In GitHub Actions, custom labels are not independent. The runner must have all assigned labels to be eligible, as labels are cumulative in determining the runner's eligibility to process a job.
labels are automatically assigned based on runner characteristics

Explanation
This statement is incorrect. Custom labels in GitHub Actions are not automatically assigned based on runner characteristics. Labels need to be manually assigned to the self-hosted runner to determine its eligibility to process a job based on specific requirements.
Overall explanation
Custom labels in GitHub Actions operate cumulatively, meaning a self-hosted runner must have all assigned labels to be eligible to process a job

********************
WRONG ANSWERS:

Labels are cumulative, and all assigned labels must match for eligibility

Cumulative operation means all assigned labels are required for eligibility

Custom labels are manually created and assigned based on specific runner characteristics, not automatically assigned

Which of the following practices are recommended when managing releases for a GitHub Action using tags? (select three)

Correct selection
move the major version tag to point to the Git ref of the current release

Explanation
Moving the major version tag to point to the Git ref of the current release helps in keeping track of the latest release and ensures that users can easily identify and access the most recent version of the GitHub Action.
Correct selection
introduce a new major version tag for changes that will break existing workflows

Explanation
Introducing a new major version tag for changes that will break existing workflows is a best practice to maintain compatibility and provide clarity to users about the impact of the changes. This helps in managing expectations and version dependencies effectively.
create and validate a release directly on the main branch before creating the release tag

Explanation
Creating and validating a release directly on the main branch before creating the release tag ensures that the release is thoroughly tested and ready for deployment. This helps in preventing issues and ensuring a smooth release process.
use non-semantic versioning to name the release tags for better clarity

Explanation
Using non-semantic versioning to name the release tags may lead to confusion and make it difficult for users to understand the significance of each release. Semantic versioning provides a clear and standardized way to communicate changes and compatibility, making it easier for users to manage dependencies.
Correct selection
release major versions with a beta tag to indicate their status

Explanation
Releasing major versions with a beta tag to indicate their status is a recommended practice to distinguish between stable releases and those that are still in testing or development. This helps users understand the maturity and stability of the release.
Overall explanation
Tags can be a good way to manage releases for an action. By using tags, users can easily distinguish between major and minor versions. The following is a list of helpful practices to consider when creating releases:

Create and validate a release on a release branch (such as release/v1) before creating the release tag (for example, v1.0.2).

Use semantic versioning.

Move the major version tag (such as v1, v2) to point to the Git ref of the current release.

Introduce a new major version tag (v2) for changes that will break existing workflows.

Release major versions with a beta tag to indicate their status; for example, v2-beta. You can remove the -beta tag when the release is ready.

********************
WRONG ANSWERS:

it's recommended to create and validate a release on a release branch before creating the release tag, not directly on the main branch.

You are working on a project within your organization that requires a custom GitHub Action. However, due to the sensitive nature of the project, you cannot make the action public. What approach should you take to ensure you can still utilize this action within your project?

convert the custom action into a Docker container and store it in a private container registry.

Explanation
Converting the custom action into a Docker container and storing it in a private container registry is a valid approach to ensure the confidentiality of the action. However, this method may involve additional complexity in managing the container registry and may not be necessary if the action can be securely stored and accessed within GitHub repositories.
utilize a separate public repository to host the custom action and grant access to specific users or organizations

Explanation
Utilizing a separate public repository to host the custom action and granting access to specific users or organizations may compromise the sensitive nature of the project. This approach introduces potential security risks and may not align with the confidentiality requirements of the project.
copy the action code into your project's repository and include it directly in your workflow files

Explanation
Copying the action code into your project's repository and including it directly in your workflow files may seem like a straightforward solution, but it can lead to code duplication, maintenance challenges, and potential synchronization issues. This approach may not be the most efficient or secure way to handle a custom GitHub Action for a sensitive project.
Correct answer
allow GitHub Actions workflows in your private repository to access another private repository containing the custom action

Explanation
By allowing GitHub Actions workflows in your private repository to access another private repository containing the custom action, you can maintain the confidentiality of the action while still being able to utilize it in your project. This approach ensures that only authorized users within your organization can access and use the custom action.
Overall explanation
To maintain the privacy of sensitive projects while still leveraging custom GitHub Actions, you can allow GitHub Actions workflows in your private repository to access another private repository containing the custom action or reusable workflow. This approach ensures that actions or workflows stored in private repositories can be used within workflows defined in other private repositories owned by the same organization or user, preserving security and privacy.

********************
WRONG ANSWERS:

While this approach might work, it could lead to code duplication and maintenance issues. Additionally, it may not be feasible for larger actions or workflows.

Utilizing a separate public repository to host the custom action and grant access to specific users or organizations contradicts the requirement of keeping the custom action private, as it suggests hosting it in a public repository.

While containerizing the action could offer some benefits, such as portability, it might not be necessary for every custom action. Additionally, it introduces added complexity and overhead.

The workflow logs do not provide enough detail to diagnose the problem with the recent Javascript action you completed. What steps should you take to continue troubleshooting the issue?

use the GitHub Actions API to retrieve additional diagnostic information about the failed job

Explanation
Using the GitHub Actions API to retrieve additional diagnostic information about the failed job can provide insights into the execution of the action and any errors that occurred. This can help you gather more context about the issue and potentially identify the root cause of the problem.
review the JavaScript action's code for potential errors or misconfigurations

Explanation
Reviewing the JavaScript action's code is a good practice to identify any potential errors or misconfigurations that could be causing the issue. By examining the code, you may be able to pinpoint where the problem lies and make necessary adjustments to resolve it.
Correct answer
enable debug logging to increase the verbosity of the job's logs

Explanation
Enabling debug logging will increase the level of detail in the job's logs, allowing you to see more information about what is happening during the execution of the JavaScript action. This can help you identify any specific issues or errors that may be causing the problem.
convert the JavaScript action to a Docker container action for more detailed logging and isolation

Explanation
Converting the JavaScript action to a Docker container action can offer more detailed logging and isolation for troubleshooting purposes. By running the action in a containerized environment, you can have more control over the execution environment and potentially isolate any issues that may be occurring during the action's execution.
Overall explanation
Enabling debug logging in the GitHub repository settings increases the verbosity of the job's logs, providing more detailed information that can help troubleshoot issues with the JavaScript action. This is a common first step to gather additional diagnostic information about the failed job.

********************
WRONG ANSWERS:

While reviewing the JavaScript action's code is a good practice, it may not directly address the issue of insufficient detail in the workflow logs. This step focuses on identifying and fixing potential errors within the action's code.

While the GitHub Actions API can retrieve information about workflows and jobs, it may not provide additional diagnostic information beyond what is available in the workflow logs. This step may not be necessary unless specific information not present in the logs is required.

Converting the JavaScript action to a Docker container action is not directly related to increasing the verbosity of the job's logs. While Docker container actions offer benefits such as isolation and portability, they may not necessarily provide more detailed logging compared to JavaScript actions.

Your company uses GitHub Actions for internal projects. You want to share custom actions and scripts across teams but keep them private. How should you distribute these components?

have developers store them directly in project repositories

Explanation
Having developers store custom actions and scripts directly in project repositories can lead to duplication of effort and inconsistency across projects. It is not an efficient way to share and maintain shared components, as it can result in version control issues and difficulties in updating and managing the components.
use publicly available actions even if they need modifications

Explanation
Using publicly available actions, even if they need modifications, may introduce security risks and dependencies on external sources. It is not advisable to rely on external actions for private projects, as they may not meet the specific requirements or security standards of the organization.
Correct answer
store them in a private repository with access control

Explanation
Storing custom actions and scripts in a private repository with access control ensures that only authorized team members can view and use these components. This approach maintains the privacy and security of the shared components while allowing for easy distribution and collaboration within the organization.
store them in a public repository with access control

Explanation
Storing custom actions and scripts in a public repository with access control may expose sensitive information to unauthorized users. It is not recommended to share private components in a public repository, even with access control, as there is a risk of accidental exposure or unauthorized access.
Overall explanation
Storing the components in a private repository ensures that only authorized team members can access them. Implementing access control further refines usage by granting permissions based on specific project needs. Therefore, utilizing a private repository with access control offers a secure and efficient solution for sharing internal components within the organization while maintaining privacy and facilitating efficient project development across teams.

********************
WRONG ANSWERS:

While a public repository with access control can limit visibility, it still exposes the components to anyone with access to the public repository, defeating the goal of complete privacy.

Individual project repositories hinder reusability and create redundancy, as components wouldn't be easily shared across projects.

Public actions with modifications introduce external security risks and might not perfectly fit specific needs, requiring potentially risky modifications.

      run: echo "$NAME"
      env:
        NAME: 'My Action 3'
this run will error because of incorrect syntax

Explanation
This run will not error because of incorrect syntax. The workflow is correctly structured, and the value of the NAME variable will be determined based on the environment variable defined at the 'run' step level.
My Action

Explanation
The value of the NAME variable will not be 'My Action' because the environment variable defined at the 'run' step level overrides the environment variable defined at the job level.
Correct answer
My Action 3

Explanation
The value of the NAME variable will be 'My Action 3' because the environment variable defined within the 'run' step takes precedence over the environment variable defined at the job level.
My Action 2

Explanation
The value of the NAME variable will not be 'My Action 2' because the environment variable defined at the 'run' step level overrides the environment variable defined at the job level.
Overall explanation
My Action 3

The workflow defines a top-level environment variable NAME with the value 'My Action'.

Within the build job, a job-level environment variable NAME with the value 'My Action 2' is defined. This overrides the top-level environment variable for the scope of the build job.

Inside the "Print name" step, another environment variable NAME with the value 'My Action 3' is defined. This overrides both the top-level and job-level environment variables for the scope of the step.

Therefore, when the "Print name" step executes the command echo "$NAME", it will print the value of the NAME variable defined within the step's environment, which is 'My Action 3'.

******************

WRONG ANSWERS

The variable NAME with the value 'My Action 2' is overridden by the variable NAME within the step whose value is `My Action 3`

The variable NAME with the value 'My Action' is overridden by the variable NAME within the job level whose value is `My Action 2` which is overridden again by the variable NAME within the step whose value is `My Action 3`

The provided workflow has the correct syntax, and the "Print name" step will execute without errors.

Explanation
The `RUNNER_ARCH` default environment variable contains information about the architecture of the runner executing the job, not the operating system. It specifies details about the processor architecture of the machine running the workflow, not the OS.
Correct answer
RUNNER_OS

Explanation
The `RUNNER_OS` default environment variable contains the operating system of the runner executing the job. It provides information about the specific operating system environment in which the GitHub Actions workflow is running, allowing for conditional logic based on the OS.
GITHUB_RUNNER_OS

Explanation
The `GITHUB_RUNNER_OS` default environment variable does not exist in GitHub Actions. It is not a valid default environment variable provided by GitHub Actions, so it does not contain information about the operating system of the runner executing the job.
RUNNER_DEBUG

Explanation
The `RUNNER_DEBUG` default environment variable is not related to the operating system of the runner executing the job. It is used for debugging purposes and provides information about the debug mode of the runner, not the OS.
Overall explanation
The RUNNER_OS environment variable provides the operating system of the runner executing the job. Possible values are Linux, Windows, or macOS.

******************

WRONG ANSWERS

The RUNNER_ARCH environment variable provides the architecture of the runner executing the job. Possible values are X86, X64, ARM, or ARM64.  It does not provide the operating system of the runner executing the job.

GitHub does not have a default environment variable with the name GITHUB_RUNNER_OS

The RUNNER_DEBUG environment variable is set only if debug logging is enabled, and always has the value of 1. It does not provide the operating system of the runner executing the job.

Your organization primarily runs its workloads on the Windows operating system and wants to start using Docker for building and testing jobs as it rearchitects its primary applications. What requirements must be met before using Docker container actions?

upgrade all GitHub repositories to use the Windows operating system as the primary environment

Explanation
Upgrading all GitHub repositories to use the Windows operating system as the primary environment is not a requirement for using Docker container actions in GitHub Actions. The choice of operating system for the repositories does not impact the ability to run Docker container actions, as it is primarily dependent on the configuration of the GitHub Actions runners.
install and configure Docker on the developer's local machines

Explanation
Installing and configuring Docker on developer's local machines is not a requirement for using Docker container actions in GitHub Actions. The focus should be on the environment where the GitHub Actions workflows are executed, which typically involves using GitHub-hosted runners with Docker support.
the Windows-based runners must have Docker installed

Explanation
While it is possible to have Docker installed on Windows-based runners, it is not the recommended approach for running Docker container actions in GitHub Actions. Using Linux-based runners with Docker installed ensures compatibility and optimal performance for Docker container actions.
Correct answer
the organization must use runners with a Linux operating system and have Docker installed

Explanation
The correct choice is to use runners with a Linux operating system and have Docker installed because Docker containers are natively supported on Linux. Windows-based runners do not support Docker containers directly, so using Linux-based runners with Docker installed is essential for running Docker container actions.
Overall explanation
Docker container actions can only be executed on runners with a Linux operating system. Self-hosted runners must use a Linux operating system and have Docker installed to run Docker container actions.

********************
WRONG ANSWERS:

While developers may need Docker installed on their local machines for local development and testing purposes, it is not required to use Docker container actions in GitHub Actions. Docker needs to be installed and configured on the self-hosted runners that execute workflows in GitHub Actions.

Although Docker can be installed on Windows-based runners, Docker container actions can only run on runners with a Linux operating system.

Making changes to the GitHub repositories will not have any impact here. To solve this issue, deploy or use runners with a Linux operating system.

    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - run: echo "/tmp" >> $GITHUB_PATH
Explanation
This configuration is valid because it uses the $GITHUB_PATH environment variable to add the /tmp directory to the PATH on an Ubuntu runner. The echo command appends the /tmp directory to the existing PATH variable, allowing Laura to access executables in the /tmp directory during the workflow execution.

Explanation
This configuration is incorrect because it tries to append the /tmp directory to the $GITHUB_ENV variable, which is used to store environment variables for the workflow. It does not modify the PATH environment variable, so it does not achieve the desired outcome of adding the /tmp directory to the PATH on the Ubuntu runner.

What is the recommended practice for treating environment variables in GitHub Actions, regardless of the operating system and shell used?

depend on the behavior of the operating system in use

Explanation
Depending on the behavior of the operating system in use for handling environment variables can lead to inconsistencies and potential issues when running workflows on different systems. It is best practice to treat environment variables consistently across all operating systems and shells to ensure portability and reliability in GitHub Actions.
Correct answer
treat environment variables as case-sensitive

Explanation
Treating environment variables as case-sensitive is the recommended practice in GitHub Actions to ensure consistency and avoid any potential issues related to case sensitivity. This approach helps maintain a standard naming convention for environment variables across different workflows and actions.
use only uppercase letters for environment variable names

Explanation
Using only uppercase letters for environment variable names is not a recommended practice in GitHub Actions. While uppercase letters are commonly used for environment variables, it is not a strict requirement. It is more important to focus on consistency and clarity in naming conventions rather than limiting variable names to uppercase letters.
ignore case sensitivity as GitHub Actions handles it automatically

Explanation
GitHub Actions does not handle case sensitivity automatically, so ignoring case sensitivity can lead to unexpected behavior and errors in the workflow. It is best practice to treat environment variables as case-sensitive to prevent any issues related to variable naming and usage.
Overall explanation
Treating environment variables as case-sensitive is good practice to avoid issues and maintain consistency in the workflow

********************

WRONG ANSWERS:

While GitHub Actions might handle case sensitivity in some contexts, you should treat environment variables as case-sensitive to ensure consistent behavior

The case-sensitivity recommendation is not about restricting to uppercase letters. Variables can be any case, and it's the consistent treatment that is emphasized

Depending on the specific OS behavior may lead to inconsistencies across different workflows and environments

What is the primary purpose of using workflow commands as a run step in a GitHub Actions workflow?

to execute custom scripts on the runner

Explanation
Using workflow commands as a run step in a GitHub Actions workflow does not primarily serve the purpose of executing custom scripts on the runner. While custom scripts can be executed within a workflow, the primary purpose of workflow commands is to interact with the GitHub Actions environment and provide instructions to the runner.
to define environment variables for the entire workflow

Explanation
Defining environment variables for the entire workflow is not the primary purpose of using workflow commands as a run step in a GitHub Actions workflow. While workflow commands can be used to set environment variables within a specific job or step, their primary purpose is to communicate instructions and information to the runner environment.
Correct answer
to communicate instructions and information to the runner environment

Explanation
Workflow commands are used as run steps in a GitHub Actions workflow primarily to communicate instructions and information to the runner environment. These commands can be used to set environment variables, create output messages, set the status of the workflow run, and interact with the GitHub Actions environment.
to trigger the workflow to move to the next step

Explanation
Workflow commands are not used as run steps in a GitHub Actions workflow to trigger the workflow to move to the next step. The progression of steps in a workflow is determined by the workflow configuration and dependencies between jobs and steps, rather than by the use of workflow commands.
Overall explanation
Workflow commands are used to interact with the runner during the execution of a step, providing a way to pass information, set environment variables, or perform other actions related to the workflow

********************
WRONG ANSWERS:

Executing scripts on the runner is a broader concept and not the primary purpose of workflow commands

Triggering the workflow to move to the next step is not the main purpose of workflow commands; they are more about communication and configuration

You need to create a new action metadata file. What syntax should you use?

Python

Explanation
Python is not the correct syntax to use when creating a new action metadata file in GitHub Actions. While Python is a powerful programming language, it is not the preferred format for defining workflows and actions in GitHub Actions.
Javascript

Explanation
Javascript is not the correct syntax to use when creating a new action metadata file in GitHub Actions. While JavaScript is a popular programming language, it is not the preferred format for defining workflows and actions in GitHub Actions.
JSON

Explanation
JSON is not the correct syntax to use when creating a new action metadata file in GitHub Actions. While JSON is a valid format for data interchange, GitHub Actions specifically uses YAML for defining workflows and actions.
Correct answer
YAML

Explanation
YAML is the correct syntax to use when creating a new action metadata file in GitHub Actions. YAML is commonly used for configuration files and is the preferred format for defining workflows and actions in GitHub Actions.
Overall explanation
All actions require a metadata file. The metadata filename must be either action.yml or action.yaml. The data in the metadata file defines the inputs, outputs, and runs configuration for your action.

Action metadata files use YAML syntax.

Correct selection
JavaScript actions

Explanation
JavaScript actions are another valid custom action type within GitHub. These actions are written in JavaScript and can be used to automate workflows and tasks within GitHub Actions.
composable actions

Explanation
Composable actions are not a valid custom action type within GitHub. The correct term for combining multiple actions into a single reusable action is composite actions, not composable actions.
Correct selection
composite actions

Explanation
Composite actions are also a valid custom action type within GitHub. These actions allow you to combine multiple individual actions into a single reusable action, simplifying workflow definitions and improving reusability.
Overall explanation
You can build Docker container, JavaScript, and composite actions.



Docker container actions: These are actions packaged as Docker containers, allowing developers to encapsulate their actions and dependencies within a container. Docker container actions provide a consistent and reproducible environment for executing actions across different platforms and environments.

JavaScript actions: JavaScript actions are written in JavaScript and run within the Node.js runtime environment. They provide flexibility for developers who are comfortable with JavaScript and want to leverage its ecosystem and libraries to create custom actions for their GitHub workflows.

Composite actions: Composite actions are reusable actions composed of other actions, allowing developers to encapsulate common patterns or sequences of steps into a single action. They promote code reusability and maintainability by enabling developers to define complex workflows as composable units that can be easily shared and reused across projects.

What is the recommended approach for storing secrets larger than 48 KB?

secrets larger than 48 KB cannot be stored

Explanation
Secrets larger than 48 KB can be stored using the recommended approach of encryption with GPG and storing the decryption passphrase as a secret. This method allows for secure storage and access of large secrets, overcoming the size limitation of regular repository secrets.
avoid storing large secrets entirely to ensure security

Explanation
Avoiding storing large secrets entirely to ensure security is not a practical solution for handling secrets larger than 48 KB. It is important to find a secure and efficient way to store and access large secrets, such as using encryption with GPG and storing the decryption passphrase as a secret.
store large secrets directly as repository secrets to avoid limitations

Explanation
Storing large secrets directly as repository secrets to avoid limitations is not the recommended approach for secrets larger than 48 KB. GitHub has a limitation on the size of secrets that can be stored, so this method may not be effective for larger secrets.
Correct answer
use a workaround involving encryption with GPG and storing the decryption passphrase as a secret

Explanation
Using a workaround involving encryption with GPG and storing the decryption passphrase as a secret is the recommended approach for storing secrets larger than 48 KB. This method allows you to securely store and access large secrets while maintaining the necessary security measures.
Overall explanation
To store secrets larger than 48 KB, you have to use encryption with GPG. The encrypted file is stored in the repository, and the decryption passphrase is stored as a secret on GitHub.

********************
WRONG ANSWERS:

Directly storing large secrets as repository secrets will not bypass the limitations on size

While there are size limitations, there is a workaround to be able to store large secrets

In a workflow requiring review, what action is taken if a job is rejected?

Correct answer
the workflow fails

Explanation
If a job is rejected in a workflow requiring review, the workflow fails as the job did not meet the required criteria for approval. This failure indicates that the job needs to be reviewed and potentially revised before proceeding further in the workflow.
the job is put on hold until further notice

Explanation
The job being put on hold until further notice is not the typical action taken when a job is rejected in a workflow requiring review. The rejection usually requires immediate attention and resolution rather than delaying the job indefinitely.
the workflow proceeds as normal

Explanation
If a job is rejected in a workflow requiring review, the workflow does not proceed as normal. The rejection indicates that there are issues with the job that need to be addressed before the workflow can continue successfully.
the job is automatically re-submitted for review

Explanation
The job being automatically re-submitted for review is not the standard behavior in GitHub Actions when a job is rejected. The workflow does not automatically retry the job without manual intervention or changes made to address the rejection reason.
Overall explanation
Once a job is approved, the job will proceed. But, if a job is rejected, the workflow will fail.

******************

What distinguishes JavaScript actions from traditional Node.js projects regarding their development and distribution?

JavaScript actions are limited to using only GitHub's APIs and do not integrate with third-party APIs

Explanation
JavaScript actions are not limited to using only GitHub's APIs; they can also integrate with third-party APIs and services. This flexibility allows developers to create more versatile and powerful actions that can interact with a wide range of external resources.
JavaScript actions do not support dependent packages and tagged releases

Explanation
JavaScript actions do support dependent packages, but they need to be included and committed alongside the code. Tagged releases are also supported for JavaScript actions, enabling versioning and distribution through the GitHub Marketplace.
JavaScript actions do not require end-to-end testing due to their simplicity

Explanation
End-to-end testing is still necessary for JavaScript actions, even though they may be simpler than traditional Node.js projects. Testing ensures that the actions work as intended and do not introduce any unexpected behavior when used in workflows.
Correct answer
JavaScript actions involve committing dependent packages alongside the code and can be published as tagged releases to the GitHub Marketplace

Explanation
JavaScript actions require committing dependent packages alongside the code because GitHub Actions do not automatically install dependencies like traditional Node.js projects. Additionally, JavaScript actions can be published as tagged releases to the GitHub Marketplace, allowing for easy distribution and discovery by other users.
Overall explanation
JavaScript actions in GitHub repositories differ from traditional Node.js projects in their development and distribution processes. They include dependent packages alongside the code and support tagged releases for direct publication to GitHub Marketplace. Due to their integration with various APIs, robust end-to-end testing is encouraged to ensure functionality and security.

********************
WRONG ANSWERS:

JavaScript actions do support dependent packages and tagged releases.

End-to-end testing is encouraged for JavaScript actions to ensure robust functionality, especially considering their potential interactions with GitHub's and third-party APIs.

JavaScript actions can make use of both GitHub's APIs and third-party APIs, making robust end-to-end testing essential for their development.

How can you define a matrix for a job in a GitHub Actions workflow?

use the matrix keyword within the runs-on parameter

Explanation
The runs-on parameter is used to specify the type of runner (e.g., Ubuntu, Windows, macOS) for the job to run on. It is not used to define a matrix of configurations for the job.

Correct answer
use the matrix keyword within the strategy configuration of the job

Explanation
Using the matrix keyword within the strategy configuration of the job allows you to define a matrix of configurations for the job. This configuration enables you to run the job with multiple configurations, such as different operating systems, versions, or environments, in parallel.

use the matrix keyword within the workflow configuration

Explanation
Using the matrix keyword within the workflow configuration is not the correct way to define a matrix for a job in a GitHub Actions workflow. The matrix keyword should be used within the strategy configuration of the job to define a matrix of configurations.

use the variables section within the job definition

Explanation
The variables section within the job definition is used to define environment variables that can be accessed within the job. It is not used to define a matrix of configurations for the job.

Overall explanation
The matrix keyword is used within the strategy configuration of the job to define a matrix of different job configuration

You have created a YAML workflow file for a common task for your team's testing. However, you are unsure where to store it in your organization. Where do the workflow file and associated metadata file need to be placed?

Correct answer
in the .github/workflows directory within the repository where the task will be executed

Explanation
The correct placement for workflow files and associated metadata files is within the .github/workflows directory within the repository where the task will be executed. This directory is specifically designed for storing GitHub Actions workflow files, making it easy to manage and access them within the context of the repository.

in the root directory of the repository where the task will be executed

Explanation
Placing the workflow file in the root directory of the repository where the task will be executed is not the recommended practice. The .github/workflows directory is the standard location for workflow files, allowing for better organization and visibility within the repository.

in a separate dedicated repository specifically for workflow files

Explanation
Creating a separate dedicated repository specifically for workflow files is not necessary and can lead to unnecessary complexity. It is best practice to keep workflow files within the repository where the task will be executed to maintain a clear and direct relationship between the code and the automation processes.
in the organization's settings, under the Workflows section

Explanation
Storing workflow files in the organization's settings under the Workflows section is not a valid option. Workflow files should be kept within the repository where the task will be executed to ensure they are properly associated with the code and tasks they are meant to automate.

Overall explanation
Reusable workflows are YAML-formatted files, very similar to any other workflow file. As with other workflow files, you locate reusable workflows in the .github/workflows directory of a repository. Subdirectories of the workflows directory are not supported.

********************
WRONG ANSWERS:

Placing the workflow file in the root directory of the repository might work, but it's a best practice to keep workflow files organized in the .github/workflows directory.

Organization settings typically manage broader configurations and permissions, not individual workflow files.

An action metadata file is required to provide information about the actions used in the workflow. This file includes details such as the name, description, inputs, outputs, and other metadata related to the actions being utilized in the workflow.
directory for storing artifacts

Explanation
A directory for storing artifacts is not a required component for setting up a GitHub Actions workflow. While artifacts can be generated and stored during the workflow run, the presence of a specific directory for storing artifacts is not mandatory for the workflow to function.
environment variables for configuring the workflow environment

Explanation
Environment variables for configuring the workflow environment are not required components for setting up a GitHub Actions workflow. While environment variables can be used to customize and configure the workflow environment, they are not essential for the basic setup of a workflow.
Correct selection
trigger events to initiate the workflow

Explanation
Trigger events are required to initiate the workflow based on specific events that occur in the repository. These events can include pushes to the repository, pull requests, issue comments, and more. Trigger events determine when the workflow should be executed.
Correct selection
workflow file in YAML format

Explanation
A workflow file in YAML format is required to define the sequence of steps, actions, and configurations for the GitHub Actions workflow. This file specifies how the workflow should be executed and what actions should be taken during the workflow run.
Overall explanation
A workflow file in YAML format is required to define the steps and actions to be executed in the workflow. An action metadata file (action.yml or action.yaml) is required for creating custom actions. Trigger events are necessary to initiate the workflow, specifying when it should be triggered, such as on pushes, pull requests, or scheduled intervals.

How can you specify dependencies between jobs in a workflow?

by organizing jobs into separate workflow files

Explanation
Organizing jobs into separate workflow files does not inherently specify dependencies between jobs in a GitHub Actions workflow. While organizing jobs into separate files can help with workflow management, it does not directly address the need to define dependencies between jobs for proper workflow execution.
by setting environment variables between jobs

Explanation
Setting environment variables between jobs is not the standard method for specifying dependencies between jobs in a GitHub Actions workflow. While environment variables can be useful for passing information between jobs, they are not specifically designed for defining job dependencies.
Correct answer
by defining dependencies in the workflow YAML file

Explanation
By defining dependencies in the workflow YAML file, you can specify the order in which jobs should run based on the success or failure of other jobs. This allows you to create a workflow that ensures certain jobs are completed before others can start, helping to manage the flow of tasks effectively.
by using the depends-on keyword in each job definition

Explanation
The depends-on keyword is not used to specify dependencies between jobs in a GitHub Actions workflow. While it is important to define dependencies, this keyword is not the correct way to achieve this in the context of GitHub Actions.

Overall explanation
Dependencies are specified using the needs keyword in the YAML file, where you list the names of the jobs that a particular job depends on.

********************

WRONG ANSWERS:

There is no depends-on keyword; dependencies are specified using the needs keyword

Setting environment variables between jobs does not establish dependencies

Organizing jobs into separate workflow files does not automatically establish dependencies

April is in charge of auditing the operations team. While conducting a review, she noticed that many workflows are accessing secrets to carry out deployment and testing functions and is concerned that these secrets may appear in logs. What information can you provide to alleviate April's concerns about workflow logs?

GitHub prompts users to manually confirm before printing secrets to workflow logs

Explanation
GitHub does not prompt users to manually confirm before printing secrets to workflow logs. Instead, the platform automatically redacts secrets to prevent accidental exposure of sensitive information in the logs.
GitHub prohibits the printing of workflow logs entirely to ensure security

Explanation
GitHub does not prohibit the printing of workflow logs entirely to ensure security. While GitHub takes measures to protect sensitive information, such as redacting secrets, workflow logs are still accessible for monitoring and troubleshooting purposes.
Correct answer
GitHub automatically redacts secrets printed to workflow logs, replacing them with placeholders

Explanation
GitHub automatically redacts secrets printed to workflow logs, replacing them with placeholders. This feature ensures that sensitive information such as secrets are not exposed in plain text within the logs, mitigating the risk of unauthorized access to confidential data.
GitHub automatically encrypts secrets before printing them to workflow logs

Explanation
GitHub does not automatically encrypt secrets before printing them to workflow logs. While encryption is important for securing sensitive information, GitHub's approach to protecting secrets in logs is through redaction rather than encryption.
Overall explanation
GitHub ensures the security of secrets printed to workflow logs within GitHub Actions by automatically redacting them. When secrets are printed to workflow logs, GitHub replaces them with placeholders to prevent their exposure. This security measure helps protect sensitive information from being unintentionally leaked or accessed by unauthorized users, ensuring the confidentiality and integrity of secrets used within GitHub Actions workflows.

********************
WRONG ANSWERS:

GitHub does not encrypt secrets before printing them to workflow logs; instead, it redacts them to prevent exposure.

GitHub does not prompt users for confirmation before printing secrets to workflow logs; it automatically redacts them.

While GitHub does enforce security measures, it does not entirely prohibit the printing of workflow logs; instead, it redacts secrets to prevent exposure.

How can you customize the schedule of a GitHub actions workflow to run on weekdays only?

utilize the on: schedule: weekdays configuration

Explanation
Utilizing the on: schedule: weekdays configuration is not a valid option for customizing the schedule of a GitHub Actions workflow to run on weekdays only. The correct approach is to use the on: schedule: cron syntax to define a custom cron expression that specifies the desired weekdays for the workflow to run.

Correct answer
use the on: schedule: cron syntax

Explanation
Using the on: schedule: cron syntax allows you to define a custom cron expression to schedule the GitHub Actions workflow. By specifying the cron expression for weekdays only, you can ensure that the workflow runs on weekdays as desired.

add a condition in the workflow YAML for weekdays

Explanation
Adding a condition in the workflow YAML for weekdays may not be a valid approach to customize the schedule of a GitHub Actions workflow. The on: schedule: cron syntax is the appropriate way to define a custom schedule, including running the workflow on weekdays only.
specify the schedule in the repository settings

Explanation
Specifying the schedule in the repository settings is not the correct method to customize the schedule of a GitHub Actions workflow to run on weekdays only. The schedule configuration should be defined within the workflow YAML file using the on: schedule: cron syntax.
Overall explanation
You can schedule a workflow to run at specific UTC times using POSIX cron syntax. So using the on: schedule: cron then the correct expression, you can customize your workflow to run on weekdays only.

********************

WRONG ANSWERS:

While you can add conditional statements in a workflow, the on: schedule: cron syntax provides a more direct way to customize the schedule based on cron expressions

While you can configure certain repository settings in GitHub, scheduling workflows is typically done with the workflow YAML file

There is no weekdays configuration, you have to use the cron syntax

A new self-hosted runner was recently registered with your organization, but you don't see it in the runner group assigned to your team. Why can't you use the new runner?

Correct answer
new runners are automatically assigned to a default group, therefore it needs to be moved to the group used by your team

Explanation
New self-hosted runners are automatically assigned to a default group when they are registered. In order for your team to use the new runner, it needs to be manually moved to the specific runner group assigned to your team within the GitHub Actions settings.
there might be network connectivity issues preventing the runner from appearing in the assigned group

Explanation
Network connectivity issues can sometimes prevent a new runner from appearing in the assigned group. Check the network settings and ensure that the runner has proper connectivity to the GitHub Actions platform to resolve any potential issues.
the permissions for accessing the runner group might not be granted to your team

Explanation
If the permissions for accessing the specific runner group have not been granted to your team, you will not be able to see or use the new runner within that group. Make sure that the necessary permissions are set up correctly for your team to access the runner.
the new runner is still undergoing initialization and configuration processes

Explanation
The initialization and configuration processes for a new runner may take some time to complete. During this period, the runner may not appear in the assigned group until the setup is fully finished and the runner is ready for use.
Overall explanation
If a newly registered self-hosted runner is not visible in the assigned runner group, it is likely because the runner has not yet been assigned to any runner group and is still in the default group. Runner visibility in groups is determined by assignment, so if the runner has not been explicitly assigned to a group, it will  appear in the default group when it has been successfully registered with the organization. Therefore, ensuring that the new runner is properly assigned to the appropriate runner group will resolve the issue of its visibility within the team's designated group.

********************
WRONG ANSWERS:

Initialization and configuration processes typically do not prevent the runner from being assigned to a runner group. Once registered, the runner should appear in the assigned group.

While permissions might affect visibility, assuming correct permissions, if the runner is not assigned to any group, it won't be visible regardless of permissions.

Network connectivity issues would affect the visibility of the runner entirely, not just its appearance in a specific runner group.

Explanation
The `github.event` context property can be used to access information about the event that triggered a workflow run in GitHub Actions. It provides details such as the event type, payload, and other relevant information that can be used within the workflow.
github.repository

Explanation
The `github.repository` context property is not used to access information about the event that triggered a workflow run. It provides details specific to the repository where the workflow is running, such as the repository name, owner, and other repository-related information.
jobs.<job_id>.result

Explanation
The `jobs..result` context property is not used to access information about the event that triggered a workflow run. Instead, it provides the result of a specific job within the workflow, identified by the job ID.
Overall explanation
Information about the event that triggered a workflow run is available in the github.event context. The properties in the github.event context depend on the type of event that triggered the workflow.  You can use the github.event context in your workflow.  The github context contains information about the workflow run and the event that triggered the run

******************

What essential step is involved in deploying a release to a cloud provider using a GitHub Actions workflow?

Correct answer
defining deployment steps in the GitHub Actions workflow YAML file

Explanation
Defining deployment steps in the GitHub Actions workflow YAML file is essential for deploying a release to a cloud provider using GitHub Actions. This step allows you to specify the actions, triggers, and conditions necessary for the deployment process to run smoothly and efficiently.
configuring multiple workflows in separate repositories

Explanation
Configuring multiple workflows in separate repositories is not directly related to deploying a release to a cloud provider using GitHub Actions. While multiple workflows can be used for different purposes within a repository, the essential step for deployment is defining the deployment steps in the workflow YAML file.
avoiding the use of environment variables during the deployment process

Explanation
Avoiding the use of environment variables during the deployment process is not recommended, as environment variables are commonly used in GitHub Actions workflows to store sensitive information and configuration settings. Utilizing environment variables can help streamline the deployment process and ensure that sensitive data is securely handled during deployment.
excluding the workflow YAML file from the repository

Explanation
Excluding the workflow YAML file from the repository would actually prevent the deployment process from being executed. The workflow YAML file contains the instructions and configurations needed for GitHub Actions to automate the deployment, so excluding it would hinder the deployment process.
Overall explanation
Deployment steps are typically defined in the YAML file associated with the workflow. So, to deploy a release to a cloud provider, you would have to configure the YAML file to this task

********************
WRONG ANSWERS:

The YAML file is essential for defining the workflow and deployment steps so you would not want to exclude the file

While executing a GitHub Actions workflow, you encounter an issue where one of the actions fails unexpectedly. How does GitHub interpret the exit code of an action?

GitHub treats all exit codes, regardless of their value, as failures, leading to the termination of the workflow run

Explanation
GitHub does not treat all exit codes as failures. In fact, a zero exit code is considered a success, while a nonzero exit code indicates a failure. This distinction helps GitHub determine whether the workflow should continue running or be terminated.
GitHub ignores the exit code of actions and relies solely on manual intervention to determine the success or failure of a workflow run

Explanation
GitHub does not ignore the exit code of actions. The exit code plays a crucial role in determining the success or failure of an action. Manual intervention is not solely relied upon to determine the outcome of a workflow run; instead, GitHub uses the exit code to make this decision.
Correct answer
GitHub interprets a zero exit code as success, indicating that the action was completed successfully and other tasks can proceed

Explanation
GitHub interprets a zero exit code as success because it indicates that the action was completed successfully without any errors. This allows the workflow to proceed to the next tasks in the sequence.
GitHub interprets a nonzero exit code as success, allowing the workflow to continue without interruption

Explanation
GitHub actually interprets a nonzero exit code as a failure, not as success. A nonzero exit code indicates that an error occurred during the execution of the action, causing the workflow to stop or fail.
Overall explanation
In GitHub Actions, the exit code of an action determines its success or failure status. A zero exit code indicates success, allowing the workflow to execute subsequent tasks. Conversely, a nonzero exit code signifies failure, leading to canceling concurrent actions and skipping future actions in the workflow. This distinction enables GitHub to accurately assess the outcome of each action and manage workflow execution accordingly.

********************
WRONG ANSWERS:

GitHub relies on the exit code of actions rather than manual intervention to determine their success or failure status.

GitHub does NOT consider all exit codes as failures, disregarding the distinction between success and failure statuses. An exit code of 0 indicated a success.

A non-zero exit code indicates failure, resulting in the termination of the workflow run.

How do events, workflows, jobs, and steps collaborate in a typical scenario?

jobs consist of one or more actions with individual workflows in a collaborative steps

Explanation
Incorrect. In a typical scenario, jobs consist of one or more actions that need to be executed as part of the workflow. Workflows are the overall orchestration mechanism that coordinates the execution of these jobs, ensuring that the steps within each job are completed successfully.

actions are initiated, which consist of one or more steps executed within jobs and workflows

Explanation
Incorrect. Actions are the individual units of work that need to be executed within a workflow. These actions consist of one or more steps that need to be completed as part of the job execution process. Workflows coordinate the execution of these actions across jobs.

Correct answer
an event will trigger a  workflow which will execute one or more jobs which consists of one or more steps

Explanation
In a typical scenario, an event serves as the trigger that initiates a workflow. This workflow can then execute one or more jobs, each of which consists of one or more steps. This sequence ensures that the necessary actions are taken in response to the event that occurred.
steps initiate actions, which are executed within workflows  within one or more jobs

Explanation
Incorrect. Steps are the individual tasks that need to be executed within a workflow. These steps initiate actions, which are the actual units of work that need to be performed. Workflows can contain multiple steps that collectively achieve the desired outcome.

Overall explanation
In GitHub Actions, workflows define automation processes triggered by events, jobs group tasks that run on specified environments, steps are individual tasks within jobs, and actions are reusable scripts within steps.

Rather than using code to create an error annotation, what can you use to send commands to the runner to create the same error annotation?

Correct answer
workflow commands provided by the actions/toolkit

Explanation
Workflow commands provided by the actions/toolkit allow you to send commands to the runner to perform various tasks, including creating error annotations. These commands provide a convenient and standardized way to interact with the GitHub Actions runner and can be used to enhance the functionality of your workflows.

environment variables prepended with the RUNNER_* annotation

Explanation
Environment variables prepended with the RUNNER_* annotation are used to access information about the runner environment, such as the operating system or the job ID. They are not intended for creating error annotations in GitHub Actions. Error annotations are typically created using workflow commands provided by the actions/toolkit for better control and consistency.

python scripts that create the specific error messages required

Explanation
Python scripts can be used within GitHub Actions workflows to perform various tasks, but they are not specifically designed to create error annotations. While you could potentially create custom error messages using Python scripts, it is not the most efficient or standard way to create error annotations in GitHub Actions.
the set-env command

Explanation
The set-env command is used to set environment variables, not to create error annotations. While environment variables are useful for passing information between steps in a workflow, they are not the appropriate tool for creating error annotations in GitHub Actions.

Overall explanation
In GitHub Actions, you can use workflow commands to send instructions to the runner environment. These commands allow you to perform various tasks, including creating error annotations, setting environment variables, printing debug messages, and more. By using workflow commands, you can create error annotations without directly modifying the workflow code.

*********************
WRONG ANSWERS:

The set-env command is used to set environment variables for subsequent steps in the workflow and is not used for creating error annotations.

Using Python scripts to create specific error messages required wouldn't be correct in GitHub Actions because error annotations are managed using built-in workflow commands rather than direct manipulation through Python scripts.

Using environment variables prepended with the RUNNER_* annotation wouldn't be correct because GitHub Actions does not follow this naming convention for environment variables. Instead, GitHub Actions provides a set of predefined environment variables and allows users to define custom ones using the env keyword in workflow files. These environment variables are accessed directly without the need for the RUNNER_* annotation.

Explanation
Specifying the repository owner and collaborators is not the role of a job and its associated steps. This information is typically managed at the repository level and does not directly relate to the definition and execution of specific tasks within a workflow using job steps.
configure the webhook events triggering the workflow

Explanation
Configuring the webhook events triggering the workflow is not the primary purpose of a job and its associated steps. While webhook events can trigger workflows, the job steps are responsible for defining the specific tasks and actions that need to be executed within the workflow, rather than managing the triggering events.
Correct answer
define a specific task or unit of work with a sequence of steps

Explanation
The purpose of a job is to define a specific task or unit of work within a workflow. It consists of a sequence of steps that need to be executed in order to complete the task efficiently. Each step represents an individual action or shell command that contributes to the overall job execution.
define the overall workflow structure

Explanation
Defining the overall workflow structure is not the primary purpose of a job and its associated steps. While the job steps contribute to the execution of the workflow, their main role is to define and execute specific tasks within the workflow, rather than determining the workflow structure as a whole.
Overall explanation
A job is a unit of work that can contain a sequence of steps. These steps include a combination of actions and shell commands. The primary purpose of a job is to define and execute a specific task or unit of work within the workflow.

You are a developer working on a project hosted on GitHub, and you've created a custom action to automate the process of deploying your application to a staging environment. The action is designed to run in a Docker container and requires several input variables to function correctly. This action could benefit other developers in the GitHub community and want to share it.

What steps should you take to share your custom action with the GitHub community?

verify that your repository is public, define the action's inputs, outputs, and environment variables, and publish the action to the GitHub Marketplace

Correct answer
ensure your repository is public, define the action's inputs, outputs, and environment variables, and publish the action as a Docker container

make sure your repository is public, define the action's inputs, outputs, and environment variables, and share the action's code directly in the repository README

confirm that your repository is public, define the action's inputs, outputs, and environment variables, and manually distribute the action's Docker image to interested developers

Overall explanation
GitHub Actions allow you to create individual, custom actions by writing code that interacts with your repository in any way you'd like, including integrating with GitHub's APIs and any publicly available third-party API. For example, an action can publish npm modules, send SMS alerts when urgent issues are created, or deploy production-ready code.

You can write your own custom actions to use in your workflow or share the actions you build with the GitHub community. To share actions you've built with the community, your repository must be public. Actions can run directly on compute resources (such as virtual machines) or in Docker containers. You can also define an action's inputs, outputs, and environment variables.

********************
WRONG ANSWERS:

sharing the action's code directly in the README is not the standard practice for sharing GitHub Actions with the community.

while the repository needs to be public to share the action, simply defining inputs and outputs is not sufficient to publish it to the GitHub Marketplace.

manually distributing the Docker image is not the recommended method for sharing GitHub Actions with the community.

Correct answer
on:

Explanation
The "on:" keyword is used in a GitHub workflow configuration to specify the triggering event that will start the workflow. It allows you to define the event that will cause the workflow to run, such as push, pull request, schedule, or other custom events.
event:

Explanation
The "event:" keyword is not a valid keyword in a GitHub workflow configuration. It is not used to match a triggering event, and using it in the configuration will result in an error.
when:

Explanation
The "when:" keyword is used in a GitHub workflow configuration to specify the conditions under which a job should run within the workflow, such as on success, failure, or always. It is not used to match a triggering event.
Overall explanation
A workflow run is triggered for any workflows that have on: values that match the triggering event. For example, you might use on: push to trigger the workflow when a push event occurs or on: pull_request to trigger the workflow when a pull request is opened or updated.

******************

WRONG ANSWERS

when: This keyword is not used in GitHub workflow configuration files to specify triggering events. It is used in conditional statements within jobs or steps to control their execution based on certain conditions, such as the success or failure of previous steps.

run: This keyword is used to specify the command or script that should be executed when the workflow is triggered. It is not used to define the triggering event itself.

event: This keyword is not used at the top level of GitHub workflow configuration files to specify triggering events. Instead, it is used within the context of specific job or step definitions to refer to the event that triggered the workflow. For example, you might use github.event_name within a step to refer to the name of the event that triggered the workflow.

What is one of the main reasons for hosting a GitHub Action in a separate repository when making it public?

it reduces the need for version control

Explanation
This choice is incorrect because hosting a GitHub Action in a separate repository does not reduce the need for version control. Version control is still essential for tracking changes, managing updates, and ensuring the stability and reliability of the action, even if it is hosted in a separate repository.
it limits the visibility of the action to the repository where it's hosted

Explanation
This choice is incorrect because hosting a GitHub Action in a separate repository does not limit its visibility to the repository where it's hosted. Public GitHub Actions can be easily discovered and used by developers across different repositories, regardless of where the action is hosted.
it increases the complexity of managing the action

Explanation
This choice is incorrect because hosting a GitHub Action in a separate repository does not necessarily increase the complexity of managing the action. In fact, it can often simplify management by providing a dedicated space for the action's code, documentation, and version control separate from the main project.
Correct answer
it makes it easier for developers to extend and fix issues with the action

Explanation
Hosting a GitHub Action in a separate repository allows developers to easily extend and fix issues with the action. By separating the action from the main project, developers can contribute to the action's codebase, make improvements, and address any bugs without directly impacting the main project's codebase.
Overall explanation
The explanation of this topic revolves around the decision-making process when creating a GitHub Action, particularly regarding where to host the action and its visibility, whether it will be public or private.

For public actions, it's recommended to host them in their own separate repository rather than bundling them with other application code. This approach allows for better versioning, tracking, and release management, similar to any other software project. By having its own repository, it becomes easier for the GitHub community to discover the action, aids developers in extending and fixing issues, and separates the action's versioning from the application code's versioning.

On the other hand, for private actions, they can be stored in any location within the repository. However, only workflows within the same repository can use these actions. When combining action, workflow, and application code in a single repository, it's recommended to store the action in the .github directory. This helps in organizing the repository and clarifying the purpose of each component.

In summary, the decision of whether to make an action public or private and where to host it depends on factors such as visibility, collaboration, and version control needs.

********************
WRONG ANSWERS:

hosting the action in a separate repository enhances version control.

hosting the action in a separate repository simplifies management and versioning.

Using workflow labels to specify which runners each workflow can utilize is more related to workflow customization rather than controlling access to specific runners for different repositories across teams. While workflow labels can help organize and categorize workflows, they do not provide a direct mechanism for controlling runner access at the repository level.
configure individual access policies for each runner within each repository

Explanation
Configuring individual access policies for each runner within each repository may lead to a complex and cumbersome management process. It is not the most efficient way to control access to specific runners for different repositories across teams, as it requires manual configuration for each runner and repository combination.
limit public access to repositories and rely on individual user permissions

Explanation
Limiting public access to repositories and relying on individual user permissions does not directly address the need to control access to specific runners for different repositories across teams. This approach focuses on repository access control rather than runner access control, which is essential for implementing security best practices in a self-hosted runner environment.
Overall explanation
Runner groups are used to collect sets of runners and create a security boundary around them. You can then decide which organizations or repositories are permitted to run jobs on those sets of machines. Organization owners can configure access policies that control which repositories in an organization have access to the runner group.

********************
WRONG ANSWERS:

While configuring individual access policies is technically possible, this becomes tedious and impractical for multiple runners and repositories.

Workflow labels can enhance control within groups but don't provide organization-wide control or security boundaries.

Limiting public access protects public repositories but doesn't address internal access control within your organization.

What is the purpose of the jobs section in a GitHub Actions workflow?

to define environment variables

Explanation
Defining environment variables is typically done in the env section of a GitHub Actions workflow, not in the jobs section. Environment variables are used to store sensitive information or configuration settings that can be accessed by the workflow steps.
Correct answer
to organize and define the steps to be executed in parallel or sequentially

Explanation
The jobs section in a GitHub Actions workflow is used to organize and define the steps that need to be executed. Jobs can run in parallel or sequentially, allowing for better control and organization of the workflow's tasks.
to declare the workflow’s triggering events

Explanation
Declaring the workflow's triggering events is typically done at the top of the workflow file using the on key, not within the jobs section. Triggering events determine when the workflow should be executed, such as on a push to a specific branch or on a schedule.
to specify the workflow name

Explanation
Specifying the workflow name is usually done at the top of the workflow file using the name key, not within the jobs section. The workflow name is used to identify the workflow in the GitHub Actions interface.
Overall explanation
The jobs section in a GitHub Actions workflow defines individual jobs, and within each job, you can specify a series of steps to be executed. Jobs can run in parallel, and you can control the flow of execution using dependencies between jobs.

********************

WRONG ANSWERS:

The env keyword is used to define environment variables

Where can you set custom environment variables in a workflow?

only in command-line arguments

Explanation
Custom environment variables cannot be set only in command-line arguments for GitHub Actions workflows. While command-line arguments can be used to pass parameters to workflows, they are not the primary method for defining and setting environment variables within the workflow itself.
Correct answer
in the workflow file

Explanation
Custom environment variables can be set directly in the workflow file using the `env` keyword. This allows you to define specific variables that can be accessed and used within the workflow steps, providing flexibility and customization for your GitHub Actions.
in your profile settings

Explanation
Setting custom environment variables in your profile settings is not the correct way to define variables for a specific GitHub Actions workflow. Environment variables defined in profile settings are global and may not provide the necessary isolation or specificity required for individual workflows. It is recommended to define environment variables directly in the workflow file for better control and management.
in the main code file

Explanation
Setting custom environment variables in the main code file is not the correct approach for GitHub Actions workflows. Environment variables defined in the main code file may not be accessible or usable within the GitHub Actions workflow context, as they are separate entities with different scopes.
Overall explanation
To set a custom environment variable for a single workflow, you can define it using the ‘env’ key in the workflow file. The scope of a custom variable set by this method is limited to the element in which it is defined.

********************
WRONG ANSWERS:

This is not a common practice as it can clutter the code and make it less maintainable

Environment variables can be set through various methods, and using only command line arguments is not a general rule for workflows

write

Explanation
'write' access is not required to download workflow artifacts. Users with 'write' access can make changes to the repository, such as editing files or creating new ones, but they do not necessarily have the ability to download workflow artifacts.
admin

Explanation
'admin' access is not specifically required to download workflow artifacts. Users with 'admin' access have the highest level of control over a repository, including the ability to manage access permissions, but this level of access is not necessary for downloading workflow artifacts.
Correct answer

Explanation
The correct level of access required to download workflow artifacts is 'read'. Users with 'read' access can view and download workflow artifacts but cannot make any changes to the repository or workflows.
owner

Explanation
'owner' access is not specifically required to download workflow artifacts. The repository owner has full control over the repository, including the ability to transfer ownership, but downloading workflow artifacts does not necessarily require this level of access.
Overall explanation
People who are signed into GitHub and have read access to a repository can download workflow artifacts.

******************

WRONG ANSWERS

Write access is not required to download workflow artifacts. Write access allows users to make changes to the repository, such as modifying files or creating branches, but it is not necessary for downloading artifacts.

Admin access is not required to download workflow artifacts. Admin access grants users full control over the repository, including the ability to manage collaborators, repository settings, and branches, but it is not necessary for downloading artifacts.

Owner access, which typically corresponds to repository ownership, is not specifically required to download workflow artifacts. While repository owners have full control over the repository, including all permissions, downloading artifacts only requires read access.

Explanation
The GITHUB_TOKEN does not expire after a fixed 12-hour period. Its validity is tied to the completion of the job or workflow, or a maximum of 24 hours, ensuring secure access to GitHub resources for the required duration.

it does not expire, and its validity is unlimited

Explanation
Contrary to the statement, the GITHUB_TOKEN does expire after a job finishes or after a maximum of 24 hours. It is not a token with unlimited validity, ensuring secure access to GitHub resources for the necessary duration.

48 hours, regardless of workflow events

Explanation
The GITHUB_TOKEN does not have a fixed expiration time of 48 hours. Its validity is based on the completion of the job or workflow, or a maximum of 24 hours, to maintain secure access to GitHub resources within that timeframe.

Correct answer
after a job finishes or after a maximum of 24 hours

Explanation
The GITHUB_TOKEN lasts until a job finishes or a maximum of 24 hours, whichever comes first. This ensures that the token is valid for the duration of the job or workflow, providing secure access to GitHub resources during that time.

You want to configure a GitHub Actions workflow to run only for specific activity types triggered by a webhook event payload. Which keyword should you use in your workflow configuration, and how can you restrict it to specific activity types?

Your answer is incorrect
use the on keyword with a conditional statement based on the event payload

use the workflow keyword with a list of event names to include

Correct answer
use the types keyword with a list of specific activity types

use the events keyword with a regex pattern to match specific event names

Overall explanation
Workflow triggers are events that cause a workflow to run. Some events have multiple activity types. For these events, you can specify which activity types will trigger a workflow run. By default, all activity types trigger workflows that run on this event. You can limit your workflow runs to specific activity types using the types keyword.

Which of the following are deployment protections that can be configured on an environment? (select three)

Correct selection
prevent self-reviews for deployment

Your selection is correct
restrict which branches can deploy to the environment

Your selection is correct
require reviewers before deployment

Your selection is incorrect
enforce a minimum code coverage

Overall explanation
Valid deployment protections that can be configured on an environment include:

Requiring reviewers before deployment ensures that changes to the codebase are reviewed by designated individuals or teams before they are deployed. This helps maintain code quality, catch potential issues, and ensure that deployments meet certain criteria before they are pushed to production or other environments.

Preventing self-reviews for deployment ensures that the individual who authored the changes cannot approve their own code for deployment. This adds an extra layer of accountability and prevents potential conflicts of interest, as it requires another team member to review and approve the changes before deployment.

Restricting which branches can deploy to the environment allows organizations to control which code changes are deployed to specific environments. By specifying the allowed branches, organizations can ensure that only approved and tested code is deployed, reducing the risk of introducing bugs or breaking changes into production environments.

******************
WRONG ANSWERS:

GitHub does not directly support enforcing a minimum code coverage threshold before deployment as a deployment protection. Code coverage checks are typically part of a continuous integration (CI) process rather than deployment protection.

You are the maintainer of a GitHub Action used by various teams in your organization. Recently, you made significant changes to the action that will break compatibility with existing workflows. How should you manage the release of this new version using tags?

follow semantic versioning and create a new major version tag v2.0.0 along with a beta tag v2-beta to indicate its experimental status

create a new release branch named release/v2 and directly create the release tag v2.0.0 on this branch without validation

Correct answer
introduce a new major version tag v2.0.0 on the main branch and update the action's metadata accordingly

release the new version v2.0.0 without indicating its status, as it is intended for internal use only

create and validate the release directly on the main branch before creating the release tag

Overall explanation
To manage breaking changes in our GitHub Action, we are adopting Semantic Versioning (SemVer). This means when we introduce changes that are not backward-compatible, we release a new major version. For example, if the current version is v1.x.x and a breaking change is made, we will release v2.0.0. This ensures that existing workflows continue to function without disruption, as they will still reference the v1 tag unless explicitly updated. By tagging the new release with v2.0.0 and providing a v2 reference, teams can easily upgrade to the latest compatible version while maintaining clarity and control over their workflows. This approach minimizes risk and provides a clear upgrade path.

********************
WRONG ANSWERS:

directly creating a release tag without proper validation goes against best practices.

Overwriting an existing release tag with a new version can cause confusion and unexpected behavior.

Even for internal use, it's essential to indicate the status of major versions, especially if they contain breaking changes.

Correct answer
group

Overall explanation
In GitHub Actions, you can use the group workflow command to create expandable groups in the workflow logs. By specifying a title with the group command, you can organize related log messages within a collapsible section, improving the readability and navigation of the workflow logs.

********************
WRONG ANSWERS:

The echo command is used to print messages to the workflow log but does not create expandable groups in the logs.

The add-mask command will mask a value to prevent a string or variable from being printed in the log.

The stop-commands command will stops processing any workflow commands. This special command allows you to log anything without accidentally running a workflow command.

submit the action's metadata file for review by GitHub, select categories, set a version tag, draft a release, and publish it

merge the action's metadata file into the repository's main branch, draft a release, select "Publish this Action to the GitHub Marketplace," and choose categories

tag a new release, push it to the repository, draft a release, select "Publish this Action to the GitHub Marketplace," and set a version tag

Overall explanation
You can add the action you've created to GitHub Marketplace by tagging it as a new release and publishing it.

To draft a new release and publish the action to GitHub Marketplace, follow these instructions:

On GitHub.com, navigate to the main page of the repository.

Navigate to the action metadata file in your repository (action.yml or action.yaml), and you'll see a banner to publish the action to GitHub Marketplace. Click Draft a release.

Under "Release Action", select Publish this Action to the GitHub Marketplace.

Note: The "Publish" checkbox is disabled if the account that owns the repository has not yet accepted the GitHub Marketplace Developer Agreement. If you own the repository or are an organization owner, click the link to "accept the GitHub Marketplace Developer Agreement", then accept the agreement. If there is no link, send the organization owner a link to this "Release Action" page and ask them to accept the agreement.

If the labels in your metadata file contain any problems, you will see an error message. Address them by updating your metadata file. Once complete, you will see an "Everything looks good!" message.

Select the Primary Category dropdown menu and click a category that will help people find your action in GitHub Marketplace.

Optionally, select the Another Category dropdown menu and click a secondary category.

In the tag field, type a version for your action. This helps people know what changes or features the release includes. People will see the version in the action's dedicated GitHub Marketplace page.

In the title field, type a release title.

Complete all other fields and click Publish release. Publishing requires you to use two-factor authentication.

Which statement best explains why a workflow triggered by the check_suite event is not executing when run from a feature branch?

workflows triggered by the check_suite event are restricted to running only on the default branch

Correct answer
the check_suite event is designed to exclusively trigger workflow runs on the default branch

the check_suite event is independent of branch location and should trigger workflow runs from any branch

GitHub Actions does not support workflow runs from feature branches triggered by the check_suite event

Overall explanation
Although only the completed activity type is supported. Specifying the activity type will keep your workflow specific if more activity types are added in the future. By default, all activity types trigger workflows that run on this event. You can limit your workflow runs to specific activity types using the types keyword.

This event will only trigger a workflow run if the workflow file is on the default branch.

********************
WRONG ANSWERS:

GitHub Actions does not support workflow runs from feature branches triggered by the check_suite event.

workflows triggered by the check_suite event can run on any branch. However, the event itself is triggered only when changes occur on the default branch.

the check_suite event is indeed dependent on the branch location. It is specifically triggered when changes occur on the default branch, so it does not trigger workflow runs from other branches.

Correct selection
maintenance overhead for managing and updating the runner environment

limited scalability compared to GitHub-hosted runners

inability to access GitHub's integrated features and updates

Correct selection

Overall explanation
Using self-hosted runners in GitHub Actions provides customization and control over the runner environment, utilizing existing infrastructure to potentially reduce costs. However, maintenance overhead, security risks, and dependency on stable network connectivity are downsides to consider. Organizations must weigh these factors carefully when deciding to implement self-hosted runners.

default environment variables are usually denoted using the dollar sign and curly braces, as ${{ variable.property }}

Correct selection
default environment variables are not accessible through the env context

Correct selection
default environment variables are available to every step in a workflow

Overall explanation
Default environment variables in GitHub Actions are all uppercase. These variables provide information about the runner environment, the repository, and the workflow run itself. The default environment variables are predefined by GitHub and are available to every step in a workflow. Because GitHub sets default environment variables and is not defined in a workflow, they are not accessible through the env context.

******************
WRONG ANSWERS:

Contexts, not default environment variables, are usually denoted using the dollar sign and curly braces, as ${{ context.property }}.  default environment variables can only be used within the runner and, therefore, must use the appropriate syntax for the shell used on the runner.

Steve wants to create a configuration variable for use across multiple workflows.  He has learned that he can define this variable at the organization, repository, or environment level.  Which value takes precedence if Steve configures a variable with the same name at each level?

repository

Correct answer
environment-level

organization

there is no precedence; the values are merged

Overall explanation
If a variable with the same name exists at multiple levels, the variable at the lowest level takes precedence. For example, if an organization-level variable has the same name as a repository-level variable, then the repository-level variable takes precedence. Similarly, if an organization, repository, and environment have a variable with the same name, the environment-level variable takes precedence.

******************
WRONG ANSWERS:

If an organization, repository, and environment have a variable with the same name, the environment-level variable takes precedence.

Custom environment variable values are not merged but follow a precedence order.  If a variable with the same name exists at multiple levels, the variable at the lowest level takes precedence.

You've recently encountered an issue with a custom JavaScript action in your GitHub Actions workflow, where the action fails to execute as expected. What is the recommended approach for troubleshooting this issue?

run the action locally using GitHub's Actions CLI tool for debugging purposes

revert to using Docker container actions for improved stability and reliability

Correct answer
examine the workflow logs to see which step caused the failure and review the failed step's build logs to troubleshoot

review the action's code for syntax errors and debugging statements

Overall explanation
When troubleshooting issues with JavaScript actions in GitHub Actions, examining the workflow logs and error messages is crucial for gaining insights into the cause of the failure. The logs often provide valuable information about errors, warnings, and the execution flow of the action, aiding in diagnosing and resolving the issue.

********************
WRONG ANSWERS:

While reviewing the action's code for syntax errors and debugging statements is a good practice, it may not always provide immediate insights into the cause of the failure when troubleshooting issues.

While running the action locally using GitHub's Actions CLI tool can be helpful for testing and debugging, it may not always replicate the exact environment and conditions of the GitHub Actions workflow, potentially leading to discrepancies in behavior.

Reverting to using Docker container actions is not a recommended troubleshooting step for issues with JavaScript actions unless there are specific reasons to believe that containerization would resolve the problem. Troubleshooting should focus on identifying and addressing the root cause of the issue within the JavaScript action itself.

        with:
          node-version: '14'
      - run: npm install -g bats
the production-deploy job will error

the production-deploy job will run if the node-version is 14

the production-deploy job will execute three steps

Correct answer
the production-deploy job will be marked as skipped

Overall explanation
The if condition specified for the production-deploy job checks whether the GitHub repository is myorg/my-dev-repo. Since the condition evaluates to false when triggered against the myorg/my-dev-repo repository, the job will be skipped and will not execute its steps. Therefore, the correct statement is that the production-deploy job will be marked as skipped.

******************

WRONG ANSWERS

The number of steps defined in a job depends on whether the job runs or is skipped based on the if condition. In this case, if the if condition is evaluated as false, the job will be skipped and won't execute any steps.

The job will not error based on the provided configuration. If the if condition is evaluated as false, the job will be skipped without causing any errors.

The if condition specified for the production-deploy job checks whether the GitHub repository is myorg/my-dev-repo, not the node version. Therefore, the node version does not affect whether the job runs or is skipped.

What is a key advantage of using self-hosted runners in a CI/CD pipeline?

integration with GitHub Actions marketplace

access to unlimited computing resources

enhanced security provided by GitHub’s infrastructure

Correct answer
allow users to customize the runner and environment

Overall explanation
Self-hosted runners offer more control of hardware, operating system, and software tools than GitHub-hosted runners provide. With self-hosted runners, you can create custom hardware configurations that meet your needs with processing power or memory to run larger jobs, install software available on your local network, and choose an operating system not offered by GitHub-hosted runners. Self-hosted runners can be physical, virtual, in a container, on-premises, or in a cloud.

********************
WRONG ANSWERS:

Self-hosted runners are constrained by the resources of the machine they are hosted on, and they do not provide access to unlimited computing resources

The integration with GitHub Actions marketplace is a feature available to both GitHub-hosted runners and self-hosted runners

Enhanced security is not a key advantage of self-hosted runners, as security depends more on the user’s configuration and environment

You have multiple types of self-hosted runners in your organization provisioned for different workloads. Which GitHub Actions feature allows you to categorize these different runners and easily incorporate them into workflows?

runner groups

runner environments

runner sets

Correct answer
runner labels

Overall explanation
In GitHub Actions, runner labels can be used to categorize different types of runners provisioned in an organization for various workloads. By assigning labels to runners based on their characteristics or intended use, such as operating system, hardware specifications, or geographical location, teams can efficiently select and utilize the appropriate runners for specific workflows. Runner labels help streamline workflow execution by ensuring tasks are assigned to runners best suited for the job, optimizing resource utilization and enhancing overall workflow efficiency.

********************
WRONG ANSWERS:

Runner groups are not a native GitHub Actions feature. They might be managed externally but are not directly related to categorizing runners within GitHub Actions.

Runner environments typically refer to different development environments like production, staging, or testing environments and are not directly related to categorizing runners for different workloads.

Runner sets are not a native GitHub Actions feature. They might be managed externally but are not directly related to categorizing runners within GitHub Actions.

How can you share actions and reusable workflows from your private repository without making them public?

Correct answer
grant access to specific users or organizations for your private repository

copy the action code into your project's repository and include it in your workflow files.

use a separate public repository to host the actions and workflows and grant access to specific users or organizations

convert the actions into Docker containers and store them in a private registry

Overall explanation
To share actions and reusable workflows from a private repository, you can grant access to specific users or organizations, allowing GitHub Actions workflows in your private repository to access the contents of another private repository containing the desired actions or workflows. This approach ensures privacy while enabling collaboration within the designated group.

********************
WRONG ANSWERS:

Converting the actions into Docker containers and storing them in a private registry introduces unnecessary complexity and might not be suitable for all actions.

Copying the action code into your project's repository can lead to code duplication and maintenance issues.

speeds up the overall execution time of a workflow

Overall explanation
Manually triggering workflow is beneficial for testing and debugging purposes. It enables you to run workflows in a controlled environment and in an intentional manner, which can be helpful when you want to test changes, troubleshoot ideas, or verify that the workflow behaves as expected.

********************

WRONG ANSWERS:

Manually triggering workflows is the opposite of running a workflow automatically. Manually triggered workflows do not run automatically in response to events like pushes or pull requests.

Manually triggering workflows does not inherently speed up the execution time. The time it takes to run a workflow is dependent on the tasks within the workflow.

define where the script output will be saved after execution

restrict the access of the script to specific directories on the runner

enhance the security of the workflow by isolating script execution environments

Correct answer
specify the location of the script files within the repository

Overall explanation
Setting a default working directory for run commands in a GitHub Actions workflow allows you to specify the location of the script files within the repository. This ensures that when you run scripts using the run keyword, GitHub Actions knows where to find them

********************
WRONG ANSWERS:

Setting the default working directory doesn't restrict access to scripts; it simply specifies their location within the repository

The working directory does not determine where the script output is saved. Output can be redirected or stored in specified locations within the workflow

Setting the working directory does not inherently enhance security or isolate execution environments. Security measures would involve other aspects of workflow configuration

You're assisting a colleague who wants to understand the differences between GitHub-hosted runners and self-hosted runners. They must choose the best option for running their team's GitHub Actions workflows. What key points would you include in your explanation to differentiate these two runner types effectively? (select three)

Self-hosted runners require less technical expertise to set up and manage

Explanation
Self-hosted runners may require more technical expertise to set up and manage than GitHub-hosted runners. Configuring and maintaining self-hosted infrastructure, including security, updates, and scalability, can be more complex and may require dedicated resources for ongoing maintenance.

Correct selection
Github-hosted runners use an ephemeral environment, which means each job typically runs on a fresh virtual machine, which means you start with a clean slate every time.

Explanation
GitHub-hosted runners operate in an ephemeral environment, meaning that each job runs on a fresh virtual machine. This ensures a clean slate for each job execution, reducing the risk of conflicts or dependencies from previous job runs. It also helps maintain consistency and reproducibility in workflow executions.
Correct selection
Self-hosted runners enable access to resources within your private network, unlike GitHub-hosted runners

Explanation
Self-hosted runners provide the ability to access resources within a private network, which is crucial for organizations that need to interact with internal systems or services that are not accessible from external networks. This ensures secure and seamless integration with internal resources.
GitHub-hosted runners allow complete control to install software or libraries and configure them for your workflows

Explanation
GitHub-hosted runners do not allow users to install custom software or libraries or configure the environment beyond the predefined settings provided by GitHub. This limitation ensures a standardized and secure execution environment for workflows but may restrict certain customization options that self-hosted runners offer.
Correct selection
Self-host runners often run on a persistent environment and can, if desired, retain custom configurations, software, and caching between jobs.

Explanation
Self-hosted runners are advantageous for teams that require a persistent environment with specific configurations, software, and caching capabilities. This allows for greater customization and control over the execution environment, making it easier to meet specific workflow requirements.
Overall explanation
GitHub-hosted runners offer a fully managed, ready-to-use environment that scales automatically and is ideal for standard workflows without the hassle of maintenance. In contrast, self-hosted runners provide complete control over the environment and hardware, allowing for customization and enhanced security, but they require additional effort to manage and maintain.

Overall explanation
You can delete the log files from your workflow runs through the GitHub web interface or programmatically. Write access to the repository is required to perform these steps.

******************
WRONG ANSWERS:

Users with "read" access to a GitHub repository have restricted permissions and can only view the repository's content. They do not have the capability to modify or delete files, including log files from workflow runs.

While users with "admin" access to a GitHub repository have full administrative privileges, including the ability to delete log files from workflow runs although this level of privelage is not required.

The repository owner, or "owner" role, has the highest level of access and control over a GitHub repository. Owners have all administrative privileges, including the ability to delete log files from workflow runs although this level of privilege is not required.

What is a recommended practice for users when referencing a GitHub Action in their workflows?

directly target the latest commit's SHA to ensure compatibility with the action

Correct answer
specify a major version when using the action, and direct to a more specific version only if issues arise

always reference the action's default branch to ensure access to the latest code

configure the workflow to automatically update to the latest version of the action

Overall explanation
A good release-management strategy should include versioning recommendations. Users should not be referencing an action's default branch with the action because the default branch is likely to contain the latest code (which might or might not be stable) and could break your workflow. Instead, we recommend that users specify a major version when using the action and only direct them to a more specific version if they encounter issues. They can do this by configuring their GitHub Actions workflow to target a tag, a commit's SHA, or a specific branch named for a release. Let's take a closer look at these release options.

********************
WRONG ANSWERS:

Referencing the action's default branch may lead to potential instability if the code is not stable. It's recommended to avoid using the default branch directly in workflows.

Directly targeting the latest commit's SHA may not provide stability as it does not ensure compatibility with specific releases. Users are advised to target specific releases for stability.

Automatically updating to the latest version of the action may introduce unforeseen issues and break the workflow. Users are encouraged to target specific versions and update only if necessary to maintain stability.

What are the benefits of reusing workflows in an organization? (select four)

Correct selection
avoids duplication

enables you to create a workflow that includes jobs for test, staging, and qa

eliminates security threats to the application

Correct selection
makes workflows easier to maintain

Correct selection
can build on the work of others

Correct selection
promotes best practice throughout the organization

Overall explanation
Rather than copying and pasting from one workflow to another, you can make workflows reusable. You and anyone with access to the reusable workflow can then call the reusable workflow from another workflow.

Reusing workflows avoids duplication. This makes workflows easier to maintain and allows you to create new workflows more quickly by building on the work of others, just as you do with actions. Workflow reuse also promotes best practices by helping you to use well-designed workflows that have already been tested and have been proven to be effective. Your organization can build up a library of reusable workflows that can be centrally maintained.

*******************
WRONG ANSWERS:

You create workflows with multiple jobs regardless if you're using reusable workflows or not, but using them will make it much easier

What is the purpose of the GITHUB_ACTIONS variable?

it represents the API URL for GitHub

it indicates the status of the GitHub Actions workflow file

it is a placeholder for the GitHub Actions workflow file

Correct answer
it always evaluates to true when GitHub Actions is running in the workflow

Overall explanation
The GITHUB_ACTIONS variable is always set to true when GitHub Actions is running the workflow. This can be used to differentiate whether tests are being run locally or GitHub Actions.

********************

WRONG ANSWERS:

GITHUB_ACTIONS does not indicate the status of the workflow run

GITHUB_ACTIONS is a variable, not a placeholder for the workflow file

The API URL is represented by the GITHUB_API_URL variable, not GITHUB_ACTIONS

What step should you take to verify the environment variables passed to your Docker container action?

inspect the environment variables within the Docker container action using the docker inspect command

check the GitHub Actions logs for a detailed breakdown of environment variable values

review the environment variables section of the Docker container action's YAML file

Correct answer
use the env command within the Docker container action to display the environment variables

Overall explanation
Inspecting the environment variables within the Docker container action using the env command allows you to verify the values passed to the action, helping to identify any misconfigurations or inconsistencies.

However, this applies only when the Docker container action is your own; if it's an external Docker container action, there is no way to use the env command.

********************
WRONG ANSWERS:

The docker inspect command is used to retrieve detailed metadata about Docker containers. However, this command does not directly provide information about the environment variables passed to a Docker container action within GitHub Actions workflows.

While YAML files may contain configuration details, they do not typically include runtime environment variables passed to a Docker container action during execution within GitHub Actions workflows.

While GitHub Actions logs may contain information about the execution of actions, they may not provide a specific breakdown of environment variable values passed to Docker container actions.

What network requirement is necessary for self-hosted runners in GitHub Actions for connectivity to GitHub?

Correct answer
permitting outbound connectivity to GitHub hosts using long polling

high-speed internet connection to minimize latency

the use of a proxy for outbound connectivity to GitHub

access to all of GitHub's public APIs and services

Overall explanation
The self-hosted runner connects to GitHub to receive job assignments and to download new versions of the runner application. The self-hosted runner uses an HTTPS long poll that opens a connection to GitHub for 50 seconds, and if no response is received, it then times out and creates a new long poll. The application must be running on the machine to accept and run GitHub Actions jobs.

Since the self-hosted runner opens a connection to GitHub.com, you do not need to allow GitHub to make inbound connections to your self-hosted runner.

You must ensure that the machine has the appropriate network access to communicate with the GitHub hosts listed below. Some hosts are required for essential runner operations, while other hosts are only required for certain functionality.

********************
WRONG ANSWERS:

While access to GitHub's public APIs and services is crucial for the functionality of GitHub Actions, it doesn't require access to ALL of GitHub's APIs and services.

While a high-speed internet connection is desirable for efficient data transfer, GitHub runners will work with slower internet speeds as well, assuming the connectivity is stable to communicate with GitHub.com services.

Using a proxy for outbound connectivity to GitHub could introduce additional network complexity and potential points of failure, which may not be conducive to maintaining reliable long polling sessions. Proxies can sometimes interfere with the establishment and maintenance of persistent connections, which are essential for long polling to function effectively. Note that this is supported by not required.

What metadata keywords within an action.yml file is used to indicate the type of action being executed?

name:
Explanation
The "name" keyword within an action.yml file is used to specify the display name of the action. It is not used to indicate the type of action being executed. The type of action is typically indicated using the "using" keyword within the "runs" section of the action.yml file.
Correct answer
runs:
  using:
Explanation
The "runs" keyword within an action.yml file is used to define the script or executable that will be run when the action is executed. The "using" keyword within the "runs" section is used to specify the type of action being executed, whether it is a JavaScript action, Docker container action, or composite run steps action.
inputs:
Explanation
The "inputs" keyword within an action.yml file is used to define the inputs that the action expects from the user. It is not used to indicate the type of action being executed. The type of action is usually specified using the "using" keyword within the "runs" section of the action.yml file.
runs:
  type:
Explanation
The "runs" keyword within an action.yml file is used to define the script or executable that will be run when the action is executed. However, the "type" keyword is not used to indicate the type of action being executed. The correct keyword for this purpose is "using" within the "runs" section.
Overall explanation
runs: is required metadata within an action.yml file that specifies whether this is a JavaScript action, a composite action, or a Docker container action and how the action is executed.

the using: keyword is used to specify the type of the action being executed, such as docker, node12, composite, etc. It defines how the action will be executed and what environment or runtime it requires.

******************

WRONG ANSWERS

while the runs: keyword is correct, the type keyword is not used directly under runs. This usage would result in a YAML syntax error.

inputs: is not a keyword directly related to the runs section in an action.yml file. The inputs keyword is used to define inputs that the action accepts, but it is not directly related to the execution or runtime environment of the action.

name: is not a keyword directly related to the runs section in an action.yml file. The name keyword is typically used to specify the name of the action, but it is not directly related to the execution or runtime environment of the action.

Artifactory

Amazon ECR

Correct answer
GitHub Container Registry

Docker Hub

Overall explanation
The ghcr.io registry is specific to GitHub and is used for hosting Docker images within GitHub's ecosystem. Therefore, the workflow publishes Docker images to the GitHub Container Registry.

******************
WRONG ANSWERS:

The configuration specifies ghcr.io as the registry, not Docker Hub. Docker Hub is another popular container registry, but this workflow is explicitly configured for GitHub Container Registry.

Artifactory is a container registry provided by JFrog, but the workflow is configured to publish to GitHub Container Registry (ghcr.io). There's no indication in the configuration that Artifactory is being used.

Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR) is a container registry provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS). However, the workflow configuration does not specify any AWS-related settings or credentials. It's configured to publish to GitHub Container Registry (ghcr.io) instead.

Jeff is troubleshooting a failed GitHub actions workflow run and is searching the build logs for a particular step. His search results are empty. What are the possible reasons for empty search results? (select two)

The build logs have been archived and are not accessible for searching

Jeff has exceeded the search query limit for the workflow run

Correct selection
Jeff's searched text is misspelled or not present in the build logs

Correct selection
Jeff has not expanded each of the steps for the job and, therefore, cannot see the results

Overall explanation
Jeff can search the build logs for a particular step, but only expanded steps are included in the results. Read access to the repository is required to perform these steps.

If the searched text is misspelled or if it does not exist in the build logs, the search results will be empty. Jeff should double-check the spelling and ensure that the text he is searching for actually appears in the logs.

******************
WRONG ANSWERS:

GitHub Actions does not impose limitations on the number of search queries within a workflow run. Therefore, the absence of search results is not due to exceeding any search query limit.

GitHub Actions typically does not archive build logs in a way that would prevent searching. Build logs are available for viewing and searching even after the workflow run has been completed.

As an enterprise owner, you want to restrict the use of GitHub Actions within your organization but still allow access to essential workflows. Which of the following configurations would achieve this goal?

set a policy to require two-factor authentication for all users running GitHub Actions workflows

allow all Marketplace actions but restrict workflows to specific organizations and repositories

Correct answer
enforce a policy to allow only local actions and reusable workflows

disable GitHub Actions for all organizations in the enterprise

Overall explanation
You can enforce policies for GitHub Actions within your enterprise's organizations or allow policies to be set in each organization. You can choose to disable GitHub Actions for all organizations in your enterprise or only allow specific organizations. You can also limit public actions and reusable workflows so people can only use local and reusable workflows in your enterprise.

********************
WRONG ANSWERS:

Disabling GitHub Actions for all organizations would completely shut down GitHub Actions, preventing even essential workflows.

Allowing all Marketplace actions but restricting workflows to specific organizations and repositories would restrict access to some actions; this still allows external Marketplace actions, potentially introducing security risks.

Setting a policy to require two-factor authentication for all users running GitHub Actions workflows would add a security layer but doesn't restrict the use of potentially harmful actions or workflows themselves.

by accessing the variables directly with the syntax version and os

by using the context keyword within the job configuration

Correct answer
reference variables through the matrix context with syntax like matrix.version and matrix.os

Overall explanation
The variables defined in the matrix become properties in the matrix context, and you can reference them using syntax like matrix.version and matrix.os

Dani wants to be notified when a comment is created on an issue within a GitHub repository. Which event should be used within the configuration?

issues.comment

issues

comment

Correct answer
issue_comment

Overall explanation
To trigger a workflow when a comment is created on an issue within a GitHub repository, Dani should use the issue_comment event within the GitHub workflow configuration. Here's how Dani can specify this event:

on:
  issue_comment:
    types: [created]
on: This keyword is used to specify the events that trigger the workflow.

issue_comment: This specifies that the workflow should be triggered when an issue comment event occurs.

types: [created]: This specifies that the workflow should only be triggered when a new comment is created on an issue. The created type filters the event to trigger only when a new comment is made.

******************
WRONG ANSWERS:

The issues event within the GitHub workflow configuration will run when an issue is created or modified but not when a comment is added or deleted from an issue.

comment is not a valid event type. Valid event types for triggering actions on creating or deleting comments include issue_comment and pull_request_review_comment

issue.comment is not a valid event type. Valid event types for triggering actions on creating or deleting comments include issue_comment and pull_request_review_comment

The IT governance team needs to create policies for using GitHub Actions to ensure compliance and security. What is the most effective approach to achieving this objective?

enforce mandatory code reviews for all GitHub Actions workflow changes to ensure adherence to organizational policies

Correct answer
implement organization-wide templates defining approved GitHub Actions workflows with pre-configured security measures

use GitHub Actions environment variables to enforce custom policies and restrictions across all repositories

conduct regular training sessions to educate developers on best practices for creating secure and compliant GitHub Actions workflows

Overall explanation
Establishing organizational policies for using GitHub Actions is crucial for ensuring consistency, compliance, and security across all projects within a large organization. Implementing organization-wide templates with predefined workflows ensures that all actions are aligned with organizational policies and include essential security measures. This approach streamlines development while maintaining compliance and security standards.

********************
WRONG ANSWERS:

While training sessions can enhance developers' understanding of secure practices, they may not ensure consistent adherence to organizational policies across all workflows.

Mandating code reviews is valuable for maintaining code quality but may not sufficiently address broader organizational policy concerns related to GitHub Actions usage.

Utilizing GitHub Actions, environment variables can help customize workflows but may not provide a comprehensive approach to enforcing organizational policies across all GitHub Actions usage.

inside a directory named workflow-templates within the current repository

inside a directory named .github/org-templates

Correct answer
inside a directory named workflow-templates within a repository named .github

inside a directory named .github/workflow-templates

Overall explanation
Starter workflows can be created by users with write access to the organization's .github repository. These can then be used by organization members who have permission to create workflows.  Workflow and metadata files must reside in the workflow-templates directory of the .github repository.
